Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you want to picture me, imagine me like a cartoon character after an explosion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with soot on my face and hair blasted back.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Sylvester is apprehensive of adding on stretch goals to the RimWorld campaign.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There are a few reasons I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t set traditional stretch goals. First, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to do anything that would threaten the basic schedule. Kickstarter projects can be destroyed by being over-funded. The creators feel too rich Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they bloat the project out, and what was a tight and well-run project becomes an over-scoped mess.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indiegamemag.com/media/Rimworld-613x330.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indiegamemag.com/media/Rimworld-613x330.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lh5.ggpht.com/-x7w_KKkSH4w/UlJz3VlVvQI/AAAAAAAAL1c/5wvOPTNG6Jo/s1600/Rimworld%2525205%25255B3%25255D.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lh5.ggpht.com/-x7w_KKkSH4w/UlJz3VlVvQI/AAAAAAAAL1c/5wvOPTNG6Jo/s1600/Rimworld%2525205%25255B3%25255D.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lh3.ggpht.com/-01pr-5lUMNE/UlJz4tUqedI/AAAAAAAAL1s/wXm_W4LvNk4/s1600/Rimworld%2525202%25255B3%25255D.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lh3.ggpht.com/-01pr-5lUMNE/UlJz4tUqedI/AAAAAAAAL1s/wXm_W4LvNk4/s1600/Rimworld%2525202%25255B3%25255D.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“My other worry with traditional stretch goals is locking in design decisions. I prefer an agile approach to game designÃ¢â‚¬Â¦So if we laid out a bunch of stretch goals now, the project would be locked into a fixed design with no chance to adjust to design feedback. This would be very, very bad. Everything good about RimWorld Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the basic concept, the control scheme, even the Western vibe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was created observationally, [by] reacting to where the game wanted to go instead of forcing it in a pre-decided direction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOn claims that RimWorld looks suspiciously similar to Introversion SoftwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prision Architect, Sylvester explained, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blame my lack of art skillÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I made the character art you see in the trailer as a stopgap, and borrowed the Prison Architect style because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not a good enough artist to develop a new oneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦With this Kickstarter, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to get a real artist who can sit down and develop an original style for RimWorld. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve talked with the original Prison Architect artist, Ryan Sumo, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fully supportive of RimWorld. We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t share any art or code with the PA guys.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dda742ef5d80cf67472e40fc71f7c719759d0b3","amp;dn":"RimWorld+%5BPre-Aplha%5D+v.0.0.232+%28PC%29+2013+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dda742ef5d80cf67472e40fc71f7c719759d0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,218,116,46,245,216,12,246,116,114,228,15,199,31,124,113,151,89,208,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
