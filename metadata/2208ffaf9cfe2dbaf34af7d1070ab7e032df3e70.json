Girlish and quirky, their vocals are more than likely either to appeal or grate on the listener. If you make it past them, there's an album full of lovely, literate, acoustic-based alt pop to be found. The songs build lyrically from the discontent of the opener &quot;Bad Mood&quot; to the in-your-face &quot;You Suck,&quot; which was a minor radio hit. Up to that point, the tone is marked with frustration and the search for contentment and belonging. Following &quot;You Suck,&quot; the mood shifts to one more upbeat and resilient tune, concluding with calm and acceptance in &quot;Beautiful Peace.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2208ffaf9cfe2dbaf34af7d1070ab7e032df3e70","amp;dn":"The+Murmurs+-+The+Murmurs+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2208ffaf9cfe2dbaf34af7d1070ab7e032df3e70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,8,255,175,156,254,45,186,243,74,247,209,7,10,183,224,50,223,62,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
