Nowadays  most stuff  gets spread  via\nFilehosters within a few minutes  or even seconds\nwhich is very sad to see!  We wonder why are some\ncrazy kids  doing this?   What is your intention?\n                   GET A LiFE!\n\nOf course we can understand  that people download\na CD to listen to it before buying. But please be\nhonest and buy it  if you really like it!  If you\ncall  yourself  a fan  then  you should  own  the\nreleases from your favorite artists  as original!\nIf  you  got  everything  as mp3 only you  should\nreflect  a bit more  about  the current situation\nin psytrance scene! Our beloved psytrance artists\naren't  popstars like  Madonna who earn thousands\nif not millions. Labels can be happy if they earn\nenough  money to cover all the production  costs!\nIf  this  continues that  way some artists (maybe\nyour #1 favorite!) will stop making music  and/or\nthe  production  of  CDs  will  stop  at  all and\neverything will be available  as digital download\nonly - but no download  can beat the warm &amp; fuzzy\nfeeling to hold a brand new CD from your favorite\nartist    or   label    in   your    own   hands!\n\nWe can't  repeat it  often enough,  the psytrance\nscene  is very small  and needs  your support. If\nyou LOVE this music (like we do), please BUY this\nmusic  or  VISIT some parties  (like we do)!  Our\nreleases are meant  for promotion  only - to give\nyou   a   sample   of    the   retail    product.\n\nNEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT'S JUST MP3!\n\nFurthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people\nwho made this  whole thing  happen,  in the past,\npresent and future.  And finally, we want to send\n greetings  to  all our  fellow  friends  within\n the    scene!   You   know    who    you   are!\n\nMUSiC WORTH LiSTENiNG iS MUSiC WORTH BUYiNG!!\n\ngroov[e]mission  2ooo - infinity!\n\nALL YOUR PSY ARE BELONG TO US!\n\nnfo update : o7-12-2o11\n\n* artwork by cpN of cRo in o4 *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580b339551182316cbf6ce709871931e6fe9a5df","amp;dn":"VA_-_Goa_2015_Vol._1-2CD-2015-gEm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580b339551182316cbf6ce709871931e6fe9a5df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,11,51,149,81,24,35,22,203,246,206,112,152,113,147,30,111,233,165,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
