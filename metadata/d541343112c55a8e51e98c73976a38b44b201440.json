A shame, really, because some of the music on this first TSC hits compilation cannot be found anywhere else.\nReleased in 1989 as the group were on their final tour, playing sets of full-on house to confused audiences everywhere, The Singular Adventures... was ambitiously billed on the cover as &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot;, while the single which preceded it, &quot;Promised land&quot;, cheekily announced it as &quot;[t]he greatest hits long-player, from Britain's most successful girl group.&quot; However, after one more single (&quot;Long hot summer 89&quot;, which actually first saw release as the &quot;Tom mix&quot; on the previous year's &quot;A Summer Quartet&quot; EP), TSC were no more.\n\nAt the time of its release, The Singular Adventures..., in addition to being the first full-length TSC compilation (three EPs were released in late 1987, and a couple of CDVs followed in 1988), would have marked the first appearances of several tracks on CD: the single mix of &quot;You're the best thing&quot;, &quot;Have you ever had it blue&quot;, &quot;Money-go-round (parts 1 &amp; 2)&quot; (though the club mix was found on Introducing The Style Council), &quot;My ever changing moods (12&quot; version)&quot;, the single version of &quot;The lodgers&quot;, and &quot;A solid bond in your heart&quot;. However, things were not all as they appeared to be.\n\nAs it turned out, while &quot;Have you ever had it blue&quot;, &quot;My ever changing moods&quot;, &quot;A solid bond in your heart&quot;, and the single version of &quot;The lodgers&quot; appeared in all their original glory, &quot;You're the best thing&quot; and &quot;Money go round&quot; were present in NEW versions, either remixed or re-recorded with new vocals. In addition, the 12&quot; version of &quot;Long hot summer&quot; was actually the above-mentioned '89 version. No mention of these is made either on the cover or in the booklet, so the consumer would have no way of knowing without actually purchasing the disc. These re-made versions alone make this disc worth having.\n\nOf course, this is a fine collection anyway. Except for &quot;Come to Milton Keynes&quot; (and the one-off Council Collective single &quot;Soul deep&quot;), all of the TSC singles are represented here, from the debut &quot;Speak like a child&quot; to the final &quot;Promised land&quot; - even &quot;Waiting&quot;, which failed to crack the UK top 40, is included.\n\nTo top it all off, The Singular Adventures... was another summertime release, perfect for a group whose music has always sounded its best on sunny spring and summer days. If you don't have this one yet, well, summertime is almost here...[/quote]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/18/Folder.md.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Style Council, The - The Singular Adventures of the Style Council\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Style Council, The\nAlbum................: The Singular Adventures of the Style Council\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989 06\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 63 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
