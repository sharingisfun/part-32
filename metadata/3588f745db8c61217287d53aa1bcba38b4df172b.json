Teddy wants Ivy to cast Charlie as the princess, but first, she must audition. At the audition, Charlie refuses to say her line. Luckily, the next girl, Tammy (Gianna Gomez), rocks her audition and makes Teddy jealous, so she pushes Ivy into giving Charlie the part in hopes that Charlie will say her line. Meanwhile, Bob has lost a lot of weight and he is excited that he can finally shop for regular clothes. Everyone is stunned when Bob gets carried away with his new makeover. Elsewhere, Gabe must do a report on an older person, so he decides to write it on their old, grumpy neighbor, Bert Doogan (Dan Desmond), stating that he had an amazing career as an astronaut. His teacher tells him that if Bert speaks to the class, she will give him extra-credit. When Bert refuses to show up and lie about his job, Gabe makes PJ pose as Bert.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3588f745db8c61217287d53aa1bcba38b4df172b","amp;dn":"Good+Luck+Charlie+S03E18+Charlie+Whisperer+720p+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3588f745db8c61217287d53aa1bcba38b4df172b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,136,247,69,219,140,97,33,114,135,213,58,161,188,186,56,180,223,23,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
