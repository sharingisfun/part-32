Following a tradition of self-improvement as old as the Republic, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“nontraditionalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ college student is becoming the norm. Back to School is the first book to look at the schools that serve a growing population of Ã¢â‚¬Å“second-chancers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ exploring what higher educationÃ¢â‚¬â€in the fullest sense of the termÃ¢â‚¬â€can offer our rapidly changing society and why it is so critical to support the institutions that make it possible for millions of Americans to better their lot in life.\n\nIn the anecdotal style of his bestselling Possible Lives, Rose crafts rich and moving vignettes of people in tough circumstances who find their way; who get a second . . . or third . . . or even fourth chance; and who, in a surprising number of cases, reinvent themselves as educated, engaged citizens. Rose reminds us that our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic and civic future rests heavily on the health of the institutions that serve millions of everyday peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€not simply the top twenty universities in U.S. News and World ReportÃ¢â‚¬â€and paints a vivid picture of the community colleges and adult education programs that give so many a shot at reaching their aspirations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79d4fa08d79c5dd4d44d527aef395f833527da8e","amp;dn":"Back+to+School-+Mike+Rose+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79d4fa08d79c5dd4d44d527aef395f833527da8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,212,250,8,215,156,93,212,212,77,82,122,239,57,95,131,53,39,218,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
