Anthony Hopkins finds all the right note to create one of the year?s most endearing oddball heroes? Ã‚Â­ Roger Ebert, Ebert &amp; Roeper\n\n?FAST, FUNNY AND BIG-HEARTED!  Hopkins gives a performance as good as any of the lead actor nominees. This is the best movie of Roger Donaldson?s career and Hopkins gives us a hero who for once is truly heroic.? ? Michael Wilmington, Chicago Tribune\n\n?ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES OF ANTHONY HOPKINS? CAREER. Roger Donaldson?s best work in two decades is a warm, spacious road movie with a stirring sense of the wide-open landscapes of the American West.? Ã‚Â­ Scott Foundas, LA Weekly\n\n?ANTHONY HOPKINS GIVES ONE OF HIS MOST INGRATIATING PERFORMANCES EVER. His larger-than-life performance rivets your attention for two solid hours in this most entertaining labor of love.? Ã‚Â­ Lou Lumenick, NY Post\n\n?AN EXCEPTIONALLY ENGAGING PERFORMANCE. Hopkins has become most celebrated for portraying commanding, often evil, men. But here he?s relaxed, humorous and enormously likable in an unpredictable turn that entirely avoids lovable old-codger clichÃƒÂ©s.?
