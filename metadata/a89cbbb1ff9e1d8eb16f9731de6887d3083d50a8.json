The CSS Detective Guide aims to help, by teaching real world troubleshooting skills. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to track clues, analyze the evidence, and get to the truth behind CSS mysteries. These arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pat solutions, but rather strategies for thinking about CSS. Author Denise Jacobs begins by going over the basics of CSS with a special emphasis on common causes of problems. Then she shows you methods for giving your code the third degree. Then youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll take a look at the line-up of usual suspects, the common problems and persistent bugs that are often encountered in CSS.\n\nFinally, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have the chance to play detective and find the guilty culprit in:\n\n    * The Case of the Devilish Details\n\n    * The Case of the Mistaken Identity\n\n    * The Case of the Single White Space\n\n    * The Case of the Float with a Mind of Its Own\n\n    * The Case of the Browser Who Hated Me\n\n    * The Case of the LOL Layout\n\nAt the end, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find that you can crack any case and solve any future mystery that you encounter, and your coding problems will become elementary.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 288 pages\n# Publisher: New Riders Press; 1 edition (April 12, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321683943\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321683946","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89cbbb1ff9e1d8eb16f9731de6887d3083d50a8","amp;dn":"The+CSS+Detective+Guide+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89cbbb1ff9e1d8eb16f9731de6887d3083d50a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,156,187,177,255,158,29,142,177,111,151,49,222,104,135,211,8,61,80,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
