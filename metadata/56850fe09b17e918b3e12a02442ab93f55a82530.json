He is listed in the book of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jazz Giants.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHe was a Navy veteran and Christian.\n\nHe became an ordained pastor and formed the duo, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jazz for JesusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with his wife, Penny, in 1977.\n\nHe died in May 2006 in Florida.\n\nI am releasing this torrent because I enjoy his music.  I feel Dean and Penny deserve to be remembered, even in this small way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56850fe09b17e918b3e12a02442ab93f55a82530","amp;dn":"Jazz+for+Jesus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56850fe09b17e918b3e12a02442ab93f55a82530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,133,15,224,155,23,233,24,179,225,42,2,68,42,185,63,85,168,37,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
