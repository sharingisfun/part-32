The period horror-romance is based on the folklore of Arang, who died unjustly and returns as a ghost in order to reveal the circumstances surrounding her death.It aired on MBC from August 15 to October 18, 2012 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes.\n\nA nobleman named Kim Eun-oh (Lee Joon-gi) comes to town searching for his mother after hearing a rumor that she is staying at the village of Miryang. He has the special ability to see spirits, but pretends he doesn't because he gets annoyed when spirits come up to him asking for a favor.\n\nArang (Shin Min-ah) has lost all her memories when she became a ghost and is unable to rest in peace until she finds out how she ended up dead. However, after appearing to three magistrates, none of them survive the fright of seeing her. When she finds out that Eun-oh is able to see her, she begs for his help.\n\nAt first, Eun-oh rejects her request. However he changes his mind after seeing that Arang is somehow in possession of the hairpin that he gave his mother at their last meeting. He believes that if he helps her, Arang will regain her memories and give him information about his mother. He exasperatedly (then affectionately) nicknames her Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmnesiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and as the town's newly installed magistrate, he teams up with her to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death, which may involve the mysterious nobleman Joo-wal and have supernatural ramifications. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arang_and_the_Magistrate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:461babcd1ef8f68f44bd5430ffdabe4bec493924","amp;dn":"Arang+and+the+Magistrate+%282012%29+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"461babcd1ef8f68f44bd5430ffdabe4bec493924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,27,171,205,30,248,246,143,68,189,84,48,255,218,190,75,236,73,57,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
