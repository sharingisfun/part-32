See here how to do it:\n\n\nWe also have a tiny message to all the lamers\nbitching about us not releasing x64 versions:\nHow about do it yourself, or STFU losers! ;)\n\nFor the visual form see:\n\nSandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space\nwhich prevents them from making permanent changes to\nother programs and data in your computer.\n\nBenefits of the Isolated Sandbox\n* Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser\nunder the protection of Sandboxie means that all\nmalicious software downloaded by the browser is\ntrapped in the sandbox and can be discarded\ntrivially.\n* Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and\ncached temporary files collected while Web\nbrowsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into\nWindows.\n* Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious\nsoftware that might be hiding in your email can't\nbreak out of the sandbox and can't infect your\nreal system.\n* Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in\nWindows by installing software into an isolated\nsandbox.\n\nSandboxie has originally been designed to increase\nthe security of browsing with Internet Explorer,\nhowever it is just as effective with any other\nbrowser, and in fact, any other program. Sandboxie\nwraps a protection layer around the programs it\nsupervises. It is this layer that intercepts and\nisolates any changes the programs make to the\ncomputer. And this layer is impartial to the\nspecific program it wraps.\n\nSandboxie was designed as an application that will\nallow you to isolate and quarantine websites. When\nyou browse the web, changes occur to your computer\nsystem. Most of the time these changes are harmless,\nlike recording the addresses of web sites you have\nvisited (and when), so the browser can help you\ncomplete a web address that you type in. Whether\nthese changes are harmless or harmful, they do in\nfact happen to your computer system.\n\nWhen you use Sandboxie to protect your browsing\nsession, it catches all these changes just as the\nbrowser is about to apply them into your computer\nsystem. Sandboxie does record these changes on\nbehalf of the browser, but it records them in a\nspecial isolated folder, called the sandbox.\n\nThe benefit of having a sandbox is that it ensures\nyour ability to get rid of all changes done by the\nbrowser, simply by deleting the sandbox folder.\n\nAnother useful feature of Sandboxie is the ability\nto terminate all sandboxed programs at once. As some\nweb sites tend to pop up three new browser windows\nfor each one you close, you can have Sandboxie close\nall of them with a click of a button.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nDo NOT distribute this release outside of the scene\nKeep the scene alive and secure!\n\nAll good progs start as freeware,\nthen things get worse ... ;-)\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n`TLB'\nTry it, Like it, Buy it!\n\n0. Enable testsigning mode (pre-requisite step).\n1. Unpack and install.\n2. Stop all Sandboxie processess (SbieCtrl, SbieSvc).\n3. Replace the original files with the included ones.\n4. Restart the computer (required step).\n\nThat's all. Have fun using it! ;-)\n\nAlways remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling\nhome 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic\nupdates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.\n\nEAT  CONTACT\n\nEAT is a closed group.
