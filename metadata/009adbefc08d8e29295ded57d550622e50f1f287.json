The quartet write and record anthemic Americana songs that thump and shine in equal measure, a cinematic sound that on this album approaches that of Delta Rae, but stays rootsier.\nSmooth, big vocal harmonies from Callie and Phoebe Cryar buff up the first two songs, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Break the CycleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Win.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The first starts with a slow intro that gradually speeds up, a brave choice to start, and the second canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help bringing to mind QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Are the Champions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The theme is a little heavy-handed, but the glorious sound makes it a winner nonetheless.\nMud seeps in on the elemental, banjo-heavy Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Kids,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best tracks, and on the slow, insistent, despairing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out WestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where a delicate mandolin merges with crunching guitars and pounding piano as the lead vocals slide from a roar to a whisper. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not Enough,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ too, boasts grunge-like volume contrasts as it goes negative with lyrics of frustration.\nThe title track returns to a densely but tastefully orchestrated pop sound to convey the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s central message, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gotta take care of each other,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“SignsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ employs a vivacious dance beat as it nods back to the New Wave era, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Leave MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is fun little nugget with an early-R&amp;B/dance beat.\nThe softer songs include the lullaby-like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Curtain,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which masks a hint of menace under a beautiful melody and softly finger-picked guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make out all the lyrics, but something sad and not-so-sweet seems to be going on. The lovely Ã¢â‚¬Å“PleaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a desperate but hopeful plea for help from a brother, or brother-in-spirit. It risesto a big creamy finish that floats on a keyboard/synth track that sounds almost like a mellotron. And the gentle Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cynical SoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ uses airy vocals and gentle banjo-picking to support biting lyrics: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blah blah blah blah, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re always talking/God help us all to do a little more walking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe Vespers take their own advice and walk a wide terrain of styles, but glued together by the country-pop vocals the variety isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t startling; instead, it keeps things interesting and surprising through the 12 songs. The album closes with its most beautiful song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thirst No More.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“How sweet the merciful song you sing/Wave after wave washing over meÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Your love is like an ocean, bottomless.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Imagery of baptism and being saved might suggest a gospel heritage, but what I read here is a depiction of an entirely human purity, wishful thinking, but wishful in the way the best art can be","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009adbefc08d8e29295ded57d550622e50f1f287","amp;dn":"The+Vespers+-+Sisters+and+Brothers+%5B2015%5D+%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009adbefc08d8e29295ded57d550622e50f1f287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,154,219,239,192,141,142,41,41,93,237,87,213,80,98,46,80,241,242,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
