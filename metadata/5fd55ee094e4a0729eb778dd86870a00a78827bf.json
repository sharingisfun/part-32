When she meets and marries handsome, successful Anthony Fleming, the charismatic man of her dreams, she believes her life is destined for happiness. She and her children move into her new husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spacious apartment in the legendary Rockwell on Central Park West. Despite her sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instinctive misgivings about the building and its residents, Caroline dismisses the odd behavior of her neighbors as pleasant eccentricities. But after her daughter begins to experience horrifying nightmares and a startling secret emerges, Caroline realizes that the magnificence of her new home masks a secret of unimaginable horror. . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd55ee094e4a0729eb778dd86870a00a78827bf","amp;dn":"Midnight+Voices+-+John+Saul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd55ee094e4a0729eb778dd86870a00a78827bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,213,94,224,148,228,160,114,158,183,120,221,134,135,10,0,167,136,39,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
