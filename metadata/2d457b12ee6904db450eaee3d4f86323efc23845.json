Born in London in 1889, Charlie Chaplin grew up in dire poverty. Severe alcoholism cut short his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flourishing career, and his beloved mother first lost her voice, then her mind, to syphilis. How did this poor, lonely child, committed to the Hanwell School for the Orphaned and Destitute, become such an extraordinary comedian, known and celebrated worldwide? Dr. Stephen M. Weissman brilliantly illuminates both the screen legend himself and the turbulent era that shaped him.\n\n\nEbook Details\n\n    File Size: 1623 KB\n    Print Length: 356 pages\n    Page Numbers Source ISBN: 1559708921\n    Publisher: Arcade Publishing; 1 edition (October 11, 2011)\n    Publication Date: October 11, 2011\n    Language: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d457b12ee6904db450eaee3d4f86323efc23845","amp;dn":"Chaplin%3A+A+Life+-+Stephen+Weissman+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d457b12ee6904db450eaee3d4f86323efc23845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,69,123,18,238,105,4,219,69,14,174,227,212,248,99,35,239,194,56,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
