The interface of the program has been designed in such a way\nthat even a beginning user will not have problems with using the\nprogram. The process of designing is based on inserting ready for use\nelements accessible in the program such as figures, images and the\nbackground, and freely shifting them on the prepared project. Another\nadvantage of the program is the possibility of saving data about a\ncompany or people so that it can be used later while designing a\nbusiness card.\n\nThe program uses templates which you can prepare on your own, or you\ncan use ready models , templates of business cards accessible in it.\n\nThe attributes of the program:\n\n- Operating jpg, bmp, wmf , png ,tiff and more graphic formats\n- A dozen or so effects which can be used while working on all\nobjects (text , image , backgrounds) for example: shadows,\ntextures, sepia, gradients and others\n\n- Export to high resolution (300 DPI , 600 DPI) pdf,jpg,tiff,bmp\ngraphics file\n- The size of designed business cards: min 70x40 max 105x65\n- The appearance of the interface can be change\n- Convert and export to CMYK ( with ICC profiles )\n- Support right to left languages (like arabic,hebrew)\n- Support unicode\n- Print on both sides of the paper (duplex printing)\n- Multilanguage support: English, German, Portuguese, Spanish,\nItalian, French, Norwegian, Swedish, Polish, Czech, Turkish,\nRussian, Bulgarian, Farsi (Persian), Serbian, Chinese\n(Simplified), Romanian\n- 400 supported business card paper for ink jet and laser printers,\nfrom Avery, APLI, Hisago, Sigel, A-One ,Printec and other\nmanufacturers.\n\ninstallnfo\n\nRun setup and follow instructions.\n\nUse the following registration details to fully unlock the program...\n\nFirst Name : CLUSTER\nLast Name  : BLIZZARD\nemail      : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0a5e4f4b474a48465024494547&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCode       : BF655E5A-5E8506C6-3F1EC171\n\ngroup-news\n\nAfter more than 11 years of nonstop releasing we are proud to present\nyou our 11000th 0day release, thus being only the third group ever\nto reach this barrier. From the day BLiZZARD was formed in february\n1998 we have always been on the very top of the release rankings and\nunlike many other groups we have almost never had any periods of\nidleness or relaxation.\nOver the years many friends joined us and we have grown to become\none of the biggest groups on the scene. New sections were created\n(mp3/iso/pda) and all of them have been a great enrichment\nfor all of us, however unity and friendship have always remained,\neven during times of upheaval and depression. All parts of BLiZZARD\nwork together with great enthusiasm and harmony. The spirit of a big\nfamily has never vanished and has always given us a very unique\ncharacter.\nAlthough we have always appreciated being one of the most active\nrelease groups our primary concern has never been to rule the scene\nbut to spend a very nice time of our lives along with many good\nfriends. Friendship and fun will always be our most valuable\nprinciples and according to them we will act. Over the years we have\nneither been involved in any groupflames nor have we offended other\nscene people without reason. Unlike many other groups we do not\nbelieve in silly and childish flames, we treat our competitors\nequal, however we want to give special props to the many old-school\ngroups which are still active and have survived all the recent busts\nand problems.\nFurthermore BLiZZARD has always offered its members a unique\natmosphere plus many benefits when it comes to release conditions.\nWe have shown the scene that you can be on the top without putting\nyour members under pressure, we simply believe in equality and\nfriendship. And, of course, many friendships, which go far beyond the\nsimple cracking business, have been formed. Every BLiZZARD member\nwill tell you what a great feeling and honour it is to be a part of\nour family. It is such a great and motivating feeling to play a part\nin it.\nFor the future we have already set many targets and we will reach\nthem for sure, expect many suprises from us.\nBLiZZARD will never die, see you soon at the 12000th release :)\n\ngreetings\n\ngreets fly out to all groups which actively and courageously work on\nbuilding better release conditions and thus keep the scene up.\nspecial greets to our friends in:\nacme - arctic - backlash - class - equinox - lnd - oddity\norion - tfa - toads - siechtum\n\nretired\n\nwe wish them the best in real life and thank them for all their\ngreat work they have done for blizzard.. we'll never forget you!!\nour fallen heroes: xxxxxx - xxxx - xxxxxxxxx - xxxxxxxxx - xxxx\nxxxxxxxxxx - XxxxxxxX - Xxxxxx\n\n?joinin?\n\nWe are a closed group, if we need you then we will contact you!\n\nSoftware worth using is worth buying.. keep this in mind!\n\nlast update on: 2006.01.01\n\nthis .nfo drawn\nby jered^blz!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d15a545d77ba4bad005fa6f266bff2ac051d35","amp;dn":"Mojosoft.Software.BusinessCards.MX.v4.81.Multilanguage.Win2kXPVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d15a545d77ba4bad005fa6f266bff2ac051d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,209,90,84,93,119,186,75,173,0,95,166,242,102,191,242,172,5,29,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
