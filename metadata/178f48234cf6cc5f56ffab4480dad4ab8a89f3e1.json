In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178f48234cf6cc5f56ffab4480dad4ab8a89f3e1","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_BVUMA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178f48234cf6cc5f56ffab4480dad4ab8a89f3e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,143,72,35,76,246,204,95,86,255,171,68,128,218,212,171,138,137,243,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
