Having been cheated of 10 million exorbitant dollars for a concert fee, 50 Cent and your choice of G-Squad thug go on a murderous rampage to reclaim his stolen bling. Featuring run-and-cover shooter game play similar to Gears of War and a scoring system similar to The Club, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand also features upgradeable weapons, hand-to-hand combat attacks as well as new and filthily disgusting taunts with which to demean your opponents.\n\nAlso included in the video game is an exclusive 50 Cent soundtrack that consists of nothing but rap songs featuring Mr. $0.50 as well as music videos in which you can see and hear him rap at the same time.\n________________________________\n\nUSE WINRAR 5 TO EXTRACT ARCHIVE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b999516a626e2573797635145487a2de95fe08","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+50+Cent%3A+Blood+on+the+Sand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b999516a626e2573797635145487a2de95fe08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,185,153,81,106,98,110,37,115,121,118,53,20,84,135,162,222,149,254,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
