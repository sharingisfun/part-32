There are only four actual songs, plus three instrumentals and a reprise of the title track. Yet the playing is suggestive of the sinuous sound that Becker and Fagen would cook up a couple of years hence in the Dan. Nevertheless, it should be sought out by hardcore fans only; there are no gems here, only some baubles.\n \nSounds like someone didn't get their 45-minute boilerplate. And condolences to instrumentalists who thought they've been writing songs. My view: eclectic mix of jazz-rock and indie rock with notes that bend like nobody's business. \n\nYou Gotta Walk It Like You Talk It\nFlotsam and Jetsam\nWar and Peace\nRoll Back the Meaning\nYou Gotta Walk It Like You Talk It (Reprise)\nDog Eat Dog\nRed Giant/White Dwarf\nIf It Rains\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1d7c2912ea572e8e6ce7d4d48cc718cc3c5740","amp;dn":"Becker%2C+Fagen%2C+Diaz+-+You+Gotta+Walk+It+%281971%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1d7c2912ea572e8e6ce7d4d48cc718cc3c5740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,29,124,41,18,234,87,46,142,108,231,212,212,140,199,24,204,60,87,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
