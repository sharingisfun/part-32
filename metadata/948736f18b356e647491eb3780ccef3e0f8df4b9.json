It was released in 2000 to mixed reviews.\n\nThe first single, &quot;Promise&quot;, was a hit on alternative rock radio, reaching #3 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and #25 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Around this time, &quot;On the Roof Again&quot; made it to #19 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Here's to the Night&quot; was a major mainstream hit in 2001, reaching #30 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nBand Bio (from Wikipedia):\nEve 6 (sometimes typeset as EVÃƒâ€ Ã…Â½ 6) is an American rock  band from Southern California who are most well known for their hits &quot;Inside Out&quot;, &quot;Leech&quot;, and the slow anthem &quot;Here's to the Night&quot;. They disbanded in 2004 and reunited with two of the three original members in October 2007.\n\nEve 6's basic rock trio (guitar/bass/drums) sound is augmented on their later studio recordings with many interesting studio techniques. For example, &quot;Bang&quot; (from Horrorscope) culminates in a section constructed entirely from repeated, overdubbed layers. Eve 6 also made liberal use of overdubbed vocals and other studio polish, such as the vocoded filigree directly preceding the breakdown section of &quot;On the Roof Again&quot; (from Horrorscope). Eve 6 has also made heavy use of a trochee  meter.\n\nEve 6 is perhaps best known for its lyrics however, which feature vivid imagery and inventive wordplay: two of the group's hits, &quot;Inside Out&quot; (from their self-titled album) and &quot;Promise&quot; (from Horrorscope), are good examples of this style. Romance and angst are common themes, but the band also explores issues of gender identity (&quot;Jet Pack,&quot; or &quot;Sunset Strip Bitch,&quot; both from Horrorscope), and suicide (&quot;Friend of Mine,&quot; from It's All in Your Head), among others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:948736f18b356e647491eb3780ccef3e0f8df4b9","amp;dn":"Eve+6+-+Horrorscope+%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"948736f18b356e647491eb3780ccef3e0f8df4b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,135,54,241,139,53,110,100,116,145,235,55,128,204,239,62,15,141,244,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
