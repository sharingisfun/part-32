The material spans most of Frank Zappa's career, from 1969 live recordings by the original Mothers of Invention (the medley &quot;Let's Make the Water Turn Black/Harry, You're a Beast/The Orange County Lumber Truck&quot; constitutes a highlight) up to the 1984 tour, with about every incarnation of his group in-between. The music is also quite varied, but focuses mainly on songs, with a few instrumentals and moments of live craziness thrown in for good measure. Special points of interest include &quot;Once Upon a Time,&quot; a segment from the lost 1970-1971 &quot;Sofa Suite,&quot; which provides important elements of conceptual continuity; a performance of &quot;The Groupie Routine&quot; from the same period, which when compared to the previously available version of this Flo &amp; Eddie comedy routine (as &quot;Do You Like My New Car?&quot; on Fillmore East, June 1971) shows how much improvisation the singers poured in their parts; and examples of stage humor (&quot;Ruthie-Ruthie,&quot; &quot;Diseases of the Band&quot;). But the real treat is the complete performance of the suite &quot;Don't Eat the Yellow Snow&quot; from 1979, replete with audience participation (spontaneous poetry!) and the finale &quot;Rollo,&quot; not officially released before. You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1 addresses both the dedicated fan and the casual listener. \n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
