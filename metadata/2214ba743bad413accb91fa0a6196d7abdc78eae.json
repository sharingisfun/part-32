Willis has a really unique right hand picking technique which really worth learning. However if you've played the bass for a long time it'll be really hard. I recommend this lesson to absolute beginners. The quality is not the best because this is a VHS rip. But I don't think it's important because the video's content is completely understandable and (in my opinion) really useful. Also, forgive me that I cannot include the booklet of the lesson in this torrent; I'm only glad that I could get the video! It wasn't easy. Whatever, have fun and play music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2214ba743bad413accb91fa0a6196d7abdc78eae","amp;dn":"Gary+Willis+-+Progressive+Bassics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2214ba743bad413accb91fa0a6196d7abdc78eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,20,186,116,59,173,65,58,204,185,31,160,166,25,109,122,189,199,142,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
