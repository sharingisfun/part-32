The batch Mp3 normalization is fulfilled under standard Replay Gain.\n\nThe Sound Normalizer contains batch processor and it allows to fulfill the batch test, batch normalization and batch converting Mp3, FLAC and Wav (PCM 8, 16, 24, 32 bits, DSP, GSM, IMA ADPCM, MS ADPCM, AC3, MP3, MP2, OGG, A-LAW, u-LAW) files.\nMore Info...\nHow to Use the Sound Normalizer...\nDownload Sound Normalizer...\n\nVolume normalization is fulfilled with help of the Mp3 Normalizer, FLAC normalizer and Wav Normalizer.\n\nThe volume level is represented graphically and in percentage.\n\nThe Wav normalization, FLAC normalization and test is fulfilled on a peak level (Peak Normalization) and on an average level (RMS normalization). The Mp3 normalization and test is fulfilled on an average level (RMS normalization).\n\nThe Mp3 normalization is fulfilled under standard Replay Gain.\n\nThe Mp3 Normalizer allows to modify a volume of a scanned file directly without usage APEv2 tags.\n\nThe Sound Normalizer also allows editing ID3 tags (build-in Mp3, FLAC ID3 Tag Editor) with support for ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, converting Wav to Mp3, Mp3 to Mp3 and Mp3 to Wav files (build-in Wav Converter, Mp3 Converter) using Lame MP3 Encoder 3.98, converting FLAC to Mp3, converting FLAC to Wav, converting Wav to FLAC, listening Mp3, FLAC and Wav files using the build-in audio player.\n\n\nRead the ReadMe file and enjoy, please seed after downloading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5b2400ea03ea808bde0f84aeb09fce56b49455","amp;dn":"Sound+Normalizer+3.7+Final+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5b2400ea03ea808bde0f84aeb09fce56b49455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,91,36,0,234,3,234,128,139,222,15,132,174,176,159,206,86,180,148,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
