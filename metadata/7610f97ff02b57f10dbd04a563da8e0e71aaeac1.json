Not much of a singer, his hits are most notable for Joe Meek's inventive production, which utilized ghostly female backup vocals, variable-speed pianos, and swirling wind effects. Most of Leyton's earliest (and most successful) material was written by Geoff Goddard, a songwriter who often penned compositions for Meek's acts; heavy on loner melodrama, it often used pseudo-wild west galloping rhythms and lyrical themes. &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot; and &quot;Wild Wind&quot; were huge hits for Leyton in 1961, and &quot;Son This Is She&quot; and &quot;Lonely City&quot; also made the Top 20 soon afterward. But in 1963, Meek and Goddard's association with Leyton ended; that circumstance, combined with the British beat boom, cast Leyton adrift immediately, although he found a lot of acting work in television and film to keep him busy.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
