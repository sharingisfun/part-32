Her first novel (began in 1989 but published in 1993), Private Relations, was started while she was waiting in a doctorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s office. Although this is when and where she started the novel, she did not finish it until four years later (1992). She focuses all of her novels around relationships, whether they are between a man and a woman, a parent and their child, siblings, or friends. Her books incorporate a mixture of family drama, suspense, and romance.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Chamberlain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2a2eefdf8e2edae3207b66178b5a7e127433c1","amp;dn":"Diane+Chamberlain+Books+%284%29%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2a2eefdf8e2edae3207b66178b5a7e127433c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,42,46,239,223,142,46,218,227,32,123,102,23,139,90,126,18,116,51,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
