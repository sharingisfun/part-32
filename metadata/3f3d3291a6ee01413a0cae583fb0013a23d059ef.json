ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Peter Grego has had a good stab at it and the resulting text contains hardly any filler in its 262 pages. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an approachable read that you will return to again and again. Hopefully, it will inspire more astronomers to observe and record the inner planets.&quot; (Grant Privett, BBC Sky at Night, June, 2008)\n\n&quot;A new guide to the two inferior planets of the solar system. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Grego provides instruction in how to observe these bodies, and describes their origins, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“geography,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and qualities unique to each planet. The work is useful to the beginner and experienced alike in the use of optics, recording methods, and specifics for each planet. A short Internet resource guide, black-and-white and color photos, a subject index, and planet-specific feature indexes enhance the book. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Summing Up: Recommended. All readers/libraries.&quot; (M. V. Golden, CHOICE, Vol. 45 (11), August, 2008)\n\n\n\nProduct Description\n\nVenus and Mercury have always been regarded as difficult targets for amateurs, but advances in commercially-made instruments have brought them within range of only moderately experienced observers. The concept of this book is to present an up-to-date detailed description of the history and geology of the inferior planets, and also to provide the best information about observing and recording them with commercially-available telescopes and cameras.\n\n\n\n See all Editorial Reviews \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 266 pages \nPublisher: Springer; 1 edition (February 1, 2008) \nLanguage: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3d3291a6ee01413a0cae583fb0013a23d059ef","amp;dn":"Venus+%26+Mercury+%26+How+to+Observe+Them+%28Astronomers+Observing+Gui","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3d3291a6ee01413a0cae583fb0013a23d059ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,61,50,145,166,238,1,65,58,12,174,88,63,176,1,58,35,208,89,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
