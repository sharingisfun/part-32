Encourages readers to type in examples as they go for immediate application of techniques presented. Includes numerous broad-based examples embedded in the text, practice exercises with solutions, and hints related to commonly encountered problems. Introduces m-files early in the text to make it easier for readers to save their work and develop a consistent programming strategy.
