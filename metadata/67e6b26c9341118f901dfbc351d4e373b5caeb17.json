Stirner repeatedly quotes Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and Bruno Bauer assuming the that the readers will be familiar with all their works. He also paraphrases and makes word-plays and in-jokes on formulations found in Hegel&amp;#039;s works as well as in the works of his contemporaries such as Ludwig Feuerbach. Other references include Greek History and Philosophy. This can make the book more demanding for contemporary readers.\n\nMax Stirner recommended, instead of social reform, a ruthless individualism that should seek satisfaction by any means and at whatever risk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e6b26c9341118f901dfbc351d4e373b5caeb17","amp;dn":"The+Ego+and+His+Own+-+Max+Stirner+%28English%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e6b26c9341118f901dfbc351d4e373b5caeb17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,230,178,108,147,65,17,143,144,29,251,195,81,212,227,115,181,202,235,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
