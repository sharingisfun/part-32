Vocalist Angela Strehli avoids that trap by simply being herself; her honesty and individuality make her cover of Major Lance's &quot;Um, Um, Um, Um, Um&quot; a legitimate treatment. Strehli's tough-talking personae was tailor-made for such songs as &quot;Two Bit Texas Town&quot; and &quot;Go On,&quot; while she managed to register pain without pathos on &quot;Can't Stop These Teardrops&quot; and &quot;I'm Just Your Fool.&quot; Only on Elmore James &quot;The Sun Is Shining&quot; did she falter, more because Albert King has established a credible alternate vision of that number. But she makes up for that with the remarkable closing tune &quot;Going to That City.&quot; While she doesn't eclipse Sister O.M. Terrell's transcendent original, she comes as close as anyone possibly could to providing a treatment that's just as valid.
