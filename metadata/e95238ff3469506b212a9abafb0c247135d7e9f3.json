But as the free market reaches its extreme limits in the economic and environmental fallout, a reassessment of capitalism's most vigorous and eloquent enemy has never been more timely. Eric Hobsbawm provides a fascinating and insightful overview of Marxism. He investigates its influences and analyses the spectacular reversal of Marxism's fortunes over the past thirty years.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Hobsbawm has lived through so much of the political turbulence he portrays that it is easy to fantasize that History itself is speaking here, in its wry, all-seeing, dispassionate wisdom. It is hard to think of a critic of Marxism who can address his or her own beliefs with such honesty and equipoise.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Terry Eagleton, London Review of Books\n\n&quot;[T]his collection shows [Hobsbawm] is a brilliant writer, erudite critic and, as he approaches his 94th birthday, a joyfully unrepentant communist. . . . [How to Change the World] is a book anyone interested in politics could and should devour. It is charmingly optimistic and constantly lucid, and contains the distilled wisdom of a great thinker, thinking about a great thinker.&quot; Amol Rajan, Independent\n\n&quot;This is a book of serious ideas, not of politics.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ben Wilson, Daily Telegraph\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“HobsbawmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ is as clear and trenchant as ever in How to Change the World.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Bookforum\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nEric Hobsbawm is professor emeritus, department of history, classics and archaeology, and president, Birkbeck University of London. He lives in London.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e95238ff3469506b212a9abafb0c247135d7e9f3","amp;dn":"Eric+Hobsbawm+-+How+to+Change+the+World.+Reflections+on+Marx+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e95238ff3469506b212a9abafb0c247135d7e9f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,82,56,255,52,105,80,107,33,42,154,186,251,12,36,113,53,215,233,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
