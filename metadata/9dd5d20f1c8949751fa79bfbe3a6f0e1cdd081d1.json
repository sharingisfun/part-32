This book makes extensive use of previously unpublished, primary-source material-much recently declassified. It gives an insight into a secret world where the public has had little idea of what was going on, while at the same time presenting a coherent nationwide picture of fighter development and evolution. Particular emphasis is placed on tender design competitions and some of the events that led to certain aircraft either being canceled or produced. Some of the many and varied types included are the Hawker P.1103/P.1136/P.1121 series, and the Fairey &quot;Delta III&quot;. The book includes many illustrations, plus specially commissioned renditions of &quot;might-have-been&quot; types in contemporary markings.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/British-Secret-Projects-Fighters-Since/dp/1857800958&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/British-Secret-Projects-Fighters-Since/dp/1857800958&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd5d20f1c8949751fa79bfbe3a6f0e1cdd081d1","amp;dn":"British+Secret+Projects+%3A+Jet+Fighters+Since+1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd5d20f1c8949751fa79bfbe3a6f0e1cdd081d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,213,210,15,28,137,73,117,31,167,155,251,227,166,240,225,205,208,129,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
