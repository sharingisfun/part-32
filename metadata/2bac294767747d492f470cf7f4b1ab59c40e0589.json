This lighthearted (but realistic) sneak-peak into the everyday world of mathematicians turns that stereotype on its head. Most people have little idea what mathematicians do or how they think. It's often difficult to see how their seemingly arcane and esoteric work applies to our own everyday lives. But mathematics also holds a special allure for many people. We are drawn to its inherent beauty and fascinated by its complexity - but often intimidated by its presumed difficulty. &quot;The Secret Life of Numbers&quot; opens our eyes to the joys of mathematics, introducing us to the charming, often whimsical side, of the discipline. Divided into several parts, the book looks at interesting and largely unknown historical tidbits, introduces the larger than - life practitioners of mathematics through the ages, profiles some of the most significant unsolved conjectures, and describes problems and puzzles that have already been solved. Rounding out the table of contents is a host of mathematical miscellany - all of which add up to 50 fun, sometimes cheeky, short takes on the field. Chock full of stories, anecdotes, and entertaining vignettes, &quot;The Secret Life of Numbers&quot; shows us how mathematics really does affect almost every aspect of life - from the law to geography, elections to botany - and we come to appreciate the delight and gratification that mathematics holds for all of us.
