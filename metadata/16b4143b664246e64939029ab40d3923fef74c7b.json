A movie not only for BMW fans. If you love extremely \nfast cars and a cat-and-mouse game with the law enforcement, Mr X will not disappoint you with this race at speeds exceeding 300 km/h. As the race goes on, Mr X tries to locate every cop in town simply to outrun them right in downtown Stockholm!\n\nThere is something here for everyone who enjoys high speeds and fast cars, test drives of extreme street cars, car meets, nightly street racing and beautiful girls?\n\nThis project begun as a fun idea in year 2000, but was cruelly dismissed by friends: You don?t dare tu put the pedal-to-the-metal through Stockholm!\n\nWell we would, and we did. Pretty fast!!! Everything you see, every sound, bump and slide is how it was.
