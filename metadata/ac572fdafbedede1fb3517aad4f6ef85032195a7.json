In the Rain\n2. Sightly Sue\n3. I Need a Change\n4. In Debt\n5. Bartarego\n6. Reflections\n7. Never Came Back\n8. Where is the Change\n9. One Long Day\n\n\nToday originals of Cooley-Munson's In Debt change hands for about $700 each. Aaron Milenski in The Acid Archives says of that early effort has &quot;a sound similar to the early Chuck &amp; Mary Perrin albums, if they didn't have female vocals. Japanese collectors crave it for those songs, though psych collectors will be more interested in 'Sightly Sue,' which has bizarre use of guitar vibrato, and 'I Need a Change' and 'Where Is The Change,' which have a bit of mild fuzz guitar (the latter has maybe the shortest and most unlikely wah wah break ever.) A few other songs have some jazzy lead guitar and complex chord progressions. Overall, somewhere between stark hippie folk and folky singer/songwriter. Loner folk fans may enjoy it, as a couple of songs are pretty dark in tone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac572fdafbedede1fb3517aad4f6ef85032195a7","amp;dn":"Cooley-Munson+-+In+Debt+%5B1972%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac572fdafbedede1fb3517aad4f6ef85032195a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,87,47,218,251,237,237,225,251,53,23,170,212,246,239,133,3,33,149,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
