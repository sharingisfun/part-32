Enraged, Hitler reacts by lashing out at the West, promising his soldiers that they will reach Paris by the new year. They donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. Three years later, his genocidal apparatus not fully in place, Hitler has barely survived a coup, while Jews cling to survival. But England and France wonder whether the war is still worthwhile.\n\nWeaving together a cast of characters that ranges from a brawling American fighter in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain to a woman who has seen HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evil face-to-face, Harry Turtledove takes us into a world shaping up very differently in 1941. The Germans and their Polish allies have slammed into the gut of the Soviet Union in the west, while Japan pummels away in the east. In trench warfare in France, French and Czech fighters are outmanned but not outfought by their Nazi enemy. Then the stalemate is shattered. In England, Winston Churchill dies in an apparent accident, and the gray men who walk behind his funeral cortege wonder who their real enemy is. The USSR, fighting for its life, makes peace with JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s war with America is about to begin.\n\nA sweeping saga of human passions, foolishness, and courage, of families and lovers and soldiers by choice and by chance, The Big Switch is a provocative, gripping, and utterly convincing work of alternate history at its best. For history buffs and fans of big, blood-and-guts fiction, Harry Turtledove delivers a panoramic clash of ideals as powerful as armies themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8367a79d51feed653527441b00cbb8a82ffc9cfb","amp;dn":"Harry+Turtledove+--+The+War+that+Came+Early+III+--+The+Big+Switc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8367a79d51feed653527441b00cbb8a82ffc9cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,103,167,157,81,254,237,101,53,39,68,27,0,203,184,168,47,252,156,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
