This release 2008 on Prestige/RVG Remasters.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nTenor saxophonist Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis and his quartet (which includes organist Shirley Scott, bassist George Duvivier and drummer Arthur Edgehill) welcome three immortal tenors (Coleman Hawkins, Arnett Cobb and Buddy Tate) to what became a historic and hard-swinging jam session. On three blues, an original based on the chord changes of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; and &quot;Lester Leaps In,&quot; the four tenors battle it out and the results are quite exciting. The spirited music on this memorable LP will hopefully be reissued on CD eventually, for the performances live up to their great potential.\n\n01. Very Saxy    \n02. Lester Leaps In    \n03.
