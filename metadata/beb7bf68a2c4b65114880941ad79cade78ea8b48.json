One day I was looking for more traditional Turkish music online and stumbled upon a song called &quot;Simarik&quot; ... and the rest is history, I suppose. Tarkan appeals to me, even though by all rights he shouldn&amp;#039;t since I dislike most popular music. But, unlike most Western popular music, there is a consistent musical sensibility which imbues all the songs here. With the exception of the dance tracks, which are somewhat interchangeable, there&amp;#039;s no question that this is _not_ an album of Western music. Turkish and Middle Eastern music enjoys a structure of scales and tones which is completely different from ours; this shows in many of Tarkan&amp;#039;s songs, which is likely why I find the album so engaging. &quot;Simarik&quot; soars with rai violins and pentatonic scales; &quot;Basina Bela Olurum&quot; evokes the music of Istanbul&amp;#039;s Gypsy community heard in smoky cafes; &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼m Sana&quot; likewise wends its way into your ears with sinous scales and rapturous, breathless verses.&quot; \n\n&quot;Tarkan, for those of you who don&amp;#039;t know him, is a Turkish pop singer (don&amp;#039;t worry, he writes his own songs). He&amp;#039;s way popular in Europe, and he rocks. It&amp;#039;s not just cliche pop, the music is really good, and since it&amp;#039;s in Turkish, it sounds so beautiful. You guys should definately check this album out.&quot; \n\n&quot;When I first heard of Tarkan, my impression was that of a sort of Turkish Ricky Martin. I have to admit I wasn&amp;#039;t overly impressed with his self-titled CD, &quot;Tarkan,&quot; when I first listened to it, but on repeated listenings, I&amp;#039;ve been converted. As far as I can tell, all the songs are sung in Turkish. The CD as a whole is a nice mix that effectively demonstrates Tarkan&amp;#039;s range. The rhythms and beats are basically pop, with accents one might call exotic. \nThe first track, &quot;Simarik,&quot; starts off with a kissing sound. This track has an exciting feel: an aggressive vocal performance is well complemented by strong percussion. The next selection, &quot;Olurum Sana,&quot; has a funkier, more sensuous feel, and is followed up by the softer, almost ethereal &quot;Bu Gece.&quot; On some selections (most notably &quot;Salina Salina Sinsice&quot; and &quot;Inci Tanem&quot;) Tarkan gets to really stretch himself vocally in classic &quot;male diva&quot; style. Another noteworthy selection is &quot;Beni Anlama&quot; (#10), whose lush, romantic sound reminded me of the songs from Luis Miguel&amp;#039;s &quot;Romance&quot; trilogy. Also, look for the spoken word interlude on the final track. &quot;Tarkan&quot; is definitely a CD worth listening to, especially for those with an interest in exploring international music.&quot; \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
