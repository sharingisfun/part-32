It will be available in Ireland only, on digital download from February 22nd and CD single the following week. \n\n\nAll profits from the release of this single will go to the Irish Cancer Society at the request of Ronnie Drew. The Irish Cancer Society is dedicated to eliminating cancer and improving the lives of those living with cancer.\n\nBono speaking at the time of the recording said &quot;Ronnie is like the King of Ireland, and we are his subjects. This is a big fight for him. But like any fighter, it&amp;#039;s easier if there&amp;#039;s a crowd cheering&quot;.\n\nThe Ballad of Ronnie Drew\n\nA tribute - recorded at Windmill Lane, January 14th and 15th, 2008\n\nProduced by John Reynolds\n\nMusicians:\nU2 (Adam Clayton, Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen Jnr) The Dubliners (Barney McKenna, Eamonn Campbell, John Sheahan, Patsy Watchorn) KÃƒÂ­la (Dee Armstrong, Eoin Dillon, Brian Hogan, Lance Hogan, Colm Ãƒâ€œ Snodaigh, RÃƒÂ³nÃƒÂ¡n Ãƒâ€œ Snodaigh, Rossa Ãƒâ€œ Snodaigh)\n\nA Band of Bowsies:\nChristy Moore, Shane MacGowan, Damien Dempsey, Andrea Corr, SinÃƒÂ©ad O&amp;#039;Connor, Moya Brennan, Glen Hansard\n\nChorus in alphabetical order:\nBilly McGuinness, Brian Kennedy, Bronagh Gallagher, Chris de Burgh, Christy Dignam, Duke Special, Eleanor McEvoy, Eleanor Shanley, Gavin Friday, Iona Green, Jack L, Jerry Fish, Joe Elliott, Mary Black, Mary Coughlan, \nMik Pyro, Mundy, Paddy Casey, Paul Brady and Ronan Keating\n\n \n\n \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f43fc749b04e8cff27164e515c3443537e0beb","amp;dn":"U2+%26+Friends+-+The+Ballad+of+Ronnie+Drew+%5BRetail-IE-320kb%2Fs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f43fc749b04e8cff27164e515c3443537e0beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,244,63,199,73,176,78,140,255,39,22,78,81,92,52,67,83,126,11,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
