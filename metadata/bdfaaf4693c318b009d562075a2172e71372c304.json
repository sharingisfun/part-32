The music is simply wonderful.  They released about 25 albums circa the 1990s. Some of it sounds like &quot;smooth jazz&quot;, featuring saxophones, flutes, clarinets and clean-sounding guitars. Some of its sounds like MPB. It's all great.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfaaf4693c318b009d562075a2172e71372c304","amp;dn":"Malandro+Records+Discography+Jazz+Brazil+MPB+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfaaf4693c318b009d562075a2172e71372c304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,250,175,70,147,195,24,176,9,213,98,7,90,33,114,231,19,114,195,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
