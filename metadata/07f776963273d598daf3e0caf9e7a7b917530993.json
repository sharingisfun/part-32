The city is being terrorized, the area is surrounded by NATO troops and media from all over the world, and the first group sent into the city disappears without a trace. The main hero of the story is the 40-year old soldier Cole Sullivan, a commando team member with extensive scientific knowledge. His team's task is to explain the hybrids' presence and to find the missing members of Group One.\n\n\nIt is, actually, not a retail version but a hack over demo.\nShould be working fully though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f776963273d598daf3e0caf9e7a7b917530993","amp;dn":"Gorky+17+%2F+Odium+%28Linux%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f776963273d598daf3e0caf9e7a7b917530993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,247,118,150,50,115,213,152,218,243,224,202,249,231,167,185,23,83,9,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
