And the Demo song.\n\nThe patch contains 100 Sound Banks; 19 Rhythm tracks; 13 Super Accompaniment tracks; and the Demo song.\n\nPatch 66 could do with tweaking. Not sure how to use Reason to trigger 'off' notes.\n\nCheck out http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jez.price/synths.htm for a VSTi version of this amazing Lo-Fi classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229f9320d68b83ee5dff2c7b16f4a4f8926f0fff","amp;dn":"Casio+SA-1+Refill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229f9320d68b83ee5dff2c7b16f4a4f8926f0fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,159,147,32,214,139,131,238,93,255,44,123,22,244,164,248,146,111,15,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
