Dr. Raymond Swain finds the coordinates he had used and is authorized by General Kirk to send Doug and Tony to rescue Ann. The scientists are received by the Curator of Canopus that tells that they are in the year 8433 AD of Earth and he used Ann as bait to bring them to his planet. Further, he intends to drain the brains of Doug and Tony to learn their experience and increase his knowledge. When the time tunnel personnel tries to bring the trio of scientists back, the time traveler Ott returns to the complex and steals the space-time converter and the tunnel is useless. Doug and Tony seek the apparatus and try to send Ann back using the teleport chamber of the aliens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b9d1e5c4f81efb0e001e504fa4cb2d535a360ba","amp;dn":"The+Time+Tunnel+-+The+Kidnappers+Ep.+28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b9d1e5c4f81efb0e001e504fa4cb2d535a360ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,157,30,92,79,129,239,176,224,1,229,4,250,76,178,213,53,163,96,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
