This ten-issue anthology series features a long list of comic book writers and artists both adapting and working directly with Vacchs to create images to go along with his words.\n\nFrom the heyday of early 90s, adult themed alternative comics, I always thought this one should have been more popular, and more talked about. Definitely recommended.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a875113d8ce4f33cdfc99a2975e1b143a96cfdb","amp;dn":"Hard+Looks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a875113d8ce4f33cdfc99a2975e1b143a96cfdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,135,81,19,216,206,79,51,205,252,153,162,151,94,27,20,58,150,207,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
