But these well-known works are not fully reflective of the built environment of Brazil, and with this volume, Richard Williams unearths the rich architectural heritage of Brazil.\n\nSpanning from 1945 through today, the book examines Brazilian architecture beyond the works of renowned architects such as Oscar Niemeyer and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCariocaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ architects of Rio de Janeiro. Williams investigates issues such as the use of historic architecture, the importance of leisure and luxury, the role of the favela as a backdrop and inspiration for development, and the rapid growth of cities. From the designated world heritage site of BrasiliaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a capital city that was planned from the ground upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to the installation work of artists such as HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lio Oiticica, Brazil delves into the origins and far-reaching influence of BrazilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s architectural modernism.\n\nAt a moment when Latin America is of increasing importance in global business and culture, Brazil will be an essential read for all scholars of architecture and Latin American history.\n\n\n# Paperback: 288 pages\n# Publisher: Reaktion Books (March 15, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1861894007\n# ISBN-13: 978-1861894007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d9dabab83f174c2f7b53fa8a27c09fe36b4e512","amp;dn":"Brazil%3A+Modern+Architectures+in+History+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d9dabab83f174c2f7b53fa8a27c09fe36b4e512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,157,171,171,131,241,116,194,247,181,63,168,162,124,9,254,54,180,229,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
