From shredding ukulele solos and 4â€“part vocal breakdowns to interweaving themed medleys, the band is sure to catch the attention of any music lover. Presenting a multitude of styles including Rock, Fusion, Ragtime, Funk, Bluegrass, Hip Hop, and even Electronica, no musical style is off-limits for this up-and-coming live-act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** One Of The Best Jamband Albums Of 2015!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce405cb44efe931484c7bc2665f8976a1b66bdb","amp;dn":"Cousin+Earth+-+Cousin+Earth+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce405cb44efe931484c7bc2665f8976a1b66bdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,228,5,203,68,239,233,49,72,76,123,194,102,95,137,118,161,182,107,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
