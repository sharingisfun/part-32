If you have others please post a link here and I will add them to the pack. \nIf anyone has other mods on their HDDs and would like to share them I will add them here. Hope we can make a compile them, because there are a lot of mods that we're great and files just simply got lost, which is sad, really.\n\nEverything is virus free, tested and the game should work well. If you have any problems, let me know in the comments.\n\n\nEnjoy,\nHave a nice day!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14d0cf5da6e83feda6810fb4e0a8d74393e293e8","amp;dn":"Europa+Barbarorum+%2B+1.2+patch+%2B+Optional+Mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14d0cf5da6e83feda6810fb4e0a8d74393e293e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,208,207,93,166,232,63,237,166,129,15,180,224,168,215,67,147,226,147,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
