On this album, the soul and funk elements that were only hinted at on Burn are much more prominent. This shift in direction was not supported by Ritchie Blackmore, who departed the band not long after Stormbringer was released.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Ritchie Blackmore, David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Jon Lord and Ian Paice except where indicated.\n\nDisc 1 [CD]\n\n01 &quot;Stormbringer&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06 \n02 &quot;Love Don't Mean a Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 \n03 &quot;Holy Man&quot; (Coverdale, Hughes, Lord) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \n04 &quot;Hold On&quot; (Coverdale, Hughes, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06 \n05 &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \n06 &quot;You Can't Do It Right&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale, Hughes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25 \n07 &quot;High Ball Shooter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \n08 &quot;The Gypsy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n09 &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 \n\nRemastered &quot;35th Anniversary Edition&quot; Bonus Tracks\n\n10 &quot;Holy Man&quot; (remix) - 4:33 \n11 &quot;You Can't Do It Right&quot; (remix) - 3:28 \n12 &quot;Love Dont Mean A Thing&quot; (remix) - 5:08 \n13 &quot;Hold On&quot; (remix) - 5:13 \n14 &quot;High Ball Shooter&quot; (instrumental) - 4:30 \n\nDisc 2 [DVD] [DTS 5.1 &amp; PCM Stereo]\n\n01 &quot;Stormbringer&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06 \n02 &quot;Love Don't Mean a Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24 \n03 &quot;Holy Man&quot; (Coverdale, Hughes, Lord) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \n04 &quot;Hold On&quot; (Coverdale, Hughes, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06 \n05 &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \n06 &quot;You Can't Do It Right&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale, Hughes) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25 \n07 &quot;High Ball Shooter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \n08 &quot;The Gypsy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n09 &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 \n\n***Note even though the back tray liner says duel layer DVD - it is NOT ***\n***You must use a .iso or image burner to burn disc 2 to DVD - I prefer IMGBURN***\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEMI (Deep Purple's label for much of the world outside the US) worked with Glenn Hughes on a remastered, expanded version of the album (much like the one done with Burn) which includes bonus remixes/alternate takes. Originally due on fall 2007, it was ultimately released on February 23, 2009 as a &quot;35th Anniversary Edition&quot; for the European/international market only. The release has been expanded into a limited edition 2 disc set: the first disc is the full remastered album along with the new remixes, and the second disc is a DVD containing the quadraphonic mix in 5.1 audio as originally released in the USA back in 1975. Once the CD/DVD edition sells out a single CD edition will follow it. A limited double gatefold vinyl edition was also released.\n\nThe name &quot;Stormbringer&quot; comes from the fantasy works of Michael Moorcock. In Moorcock's novels, Stormbringer is an evil magical sword that drains the souls of all the people it kills. According to Moorcock, the members of Deep Purple were familiar with his work before they chose that name, but were under the misimpression that the name &quot;Stormbringer&quot; was from ancient mythology, when in fact it was invented by Moorcock\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRitchie Blackmore - guitar \nDavid Coverdale - lead vocals \nGlenn Hughes - bass, harmony and backing vocals \nJon Lord - organ, keyboards \nIan Paice - drums \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84610a2ee0f8c7e477a3cfe893329cf47cb02b40","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+%5C%27Stormbringer+%5B35th+Anniversary+Edition%5D%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84610a2ee0f8c7e477a3cfe893329cf47cb02b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,97,10,46,224,248,199,228,119,163,207,232,147,50,156,244,124,176,43,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
