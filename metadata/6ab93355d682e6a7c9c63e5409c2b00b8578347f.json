And no, he doesn't care. He's got money and power, and he depends on no one. But when his estranged father dies, willing him a secret island, Roen will come face to face with an even bigger secret: its occupants. And these savage, sea-obsessed warriors are quick to make their position clear: Leave now or die.\nThere's only one problem. Nobody tells Roen what to do. Ever. Oh, and one other thing. He's just met the island's other new &quot;guest&quot; and something about her brings out his possessive side.\nSole shipwreck survivor Liv Stratton had been adrift at sea for ten grueling days when salvation miraculously appeared: an uncharted island. Only, the deceivingly beautiful men who live there aren't interested in saving her. No, not at all. Because they somehow believe she is their property, a gift from the ocean to do with as they please. This is not good.\nHer only hope? Billionaire Roen Doran, of all people. A man who's said to care for nothing and no one. But if he's so heartless, then why is he about to risk everything to help her?\n\nNumber of pages: 248\n\nISBN13: 9780990304876\n\nISBN10: 0990304876\n\nFormat: EPUB &amp; MOBI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab93355d682e6a7c9c63e5409c2b00b8578347f","amp;dn":"Mermen+%28Mermen+%231%29+by+Mimi+Jean+Pamfiloff+%5BEPUB+%2B+MOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab93355d682e6a7c9c63e5409c2b00b8578347f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,185,51,85,214,130,230,167,201,198,62,84,9,194,176,11,133,120,52,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
