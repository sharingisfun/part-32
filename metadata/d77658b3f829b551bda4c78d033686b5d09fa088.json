The original game was designed by Chuck Sommerville, who also made about a third of the levels. Most of the conversions from the Atari Lynx original to other formats were carried out by Images Software of Fareham.\n\nThe basic plot of the game is that high-school nerd Chip McCallahan has met Melinda The Mental Marvel in the school science laboratory and must navigate through Melinda&amp;#039;s &quot;Clubhouse&quot; (a series of increasingly difficult puzzles) in order to prove himself and gain membership to the very exclusive Bit Buster Club.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d77658b3f829b551bda4c78d033686b5d09fa088","amp;dn":"Chip%5C%27s+Challenge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d77658b3f829b551bda4c78d033686b5d09fa088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,118,88,179,248,41,181,81,189,164,199,141,3,54,134,181,208,159,160,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
