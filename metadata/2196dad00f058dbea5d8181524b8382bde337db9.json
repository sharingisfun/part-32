Having contributed to several Van Morrison albums and many of his live shows, and having enjoyed three multi-platinum hits in his homeland, Belfast-born Kennedy is already a big star in Ireland. He&amp;#039;s also made inroads into other territories, touring with Tina Turner and the Corrs, and performing in Riverdance on Broadway. And this album--much of it co-written with the stalwart likes of Paul Brady, Boo Hewerdine and Curtis Stigers--is sure to bring more success. Though he occasionally descends into boy-band-ballad clichÃƒÂ© (&quot;Everytime&quot; and &quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot;), Kennedy has put together a collection of relentless good taste. &quot;Call Me Old Fashioned&quot; is sparse and touching: (&quot;Looking In) the Wrong Place&quot;, with its snatches of banjo and cleverly timed electronic whine, is beautifully put together by part-time collaborator Calum MacColl; &quot;If You Love Me&quot; shares the cool atmospherics of Sade: &quot;So What If It Rains&quot; approaches the melodic melodrama of Richard Marx, while the title track, softly railing at contemporary obsessions with youth and slimness, recalls 10CC&amp;#039;s classic &quot;I&amp;#039;m Not In Love&quot;. Yet Kennedy&amp;#039;s main strength lies in his voice. He never growls or flips like Van, or soars like Tim Buckley, but his vocal is always clear and unfailingly pretty.\n\n- amazon.co.uk\n\n1.
