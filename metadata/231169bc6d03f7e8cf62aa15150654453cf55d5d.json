Expelled from Rugby for drunkenness, and none too welcome at home after seducing his father's mistress, the young Flashman embarks on a military career with Lord Cardigan's Hussars. En route to Afghanistan, our hero hones his skills as a soldier, duellist, imposter, coward and amorist (mastering all 97 ways of Hindu love-making during a brief sojourn in Calcutta), before being pressed into reluctant service as a secret agent. His Afghan adventures culminate in a starring role in that great historic disaster, the Retreat from Kabul.\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:231169bc6d03f7e8cf62aa15150654453cf55d5d","amp;dn":"Flashman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"231169bc6d03f7e8cf62aa15150654453cf55d5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,17,105,188,109,3,247,232,207,98,170,21,21,6,84,69,60,245,93,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
