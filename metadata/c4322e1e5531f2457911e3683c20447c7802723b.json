Produced by Paul McCartney and featuring numbers from Donovan, Harry Nilsson and, in rare songwriting mode, George Martin; plus classics from the Gershwins and Irving Berlin. Mary's pure, folk-inspired vocals make for a beguiling, dreamy album. Although not included on the original UK LP, MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global smash hit Ã¢â‚¬ËœThose Were The DaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is now the staple track on Post Card (1968).\n\nThis Remastered CD includes four Bonus Tracks, three of which were produced by Paul McCartney, and one by Geoff Emerick. One of these is previously unreleased Ã¢â‚¬â€ a cancelled Mary Hopkin single from 1969\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœTurn Turn TurnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ / 1968 B-side to Ã¢â‚¬ËœThose Were The DaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoodbyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ / MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second hit single, written by Paul McCartney\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœSparrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ / 1969 B-side to Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoodbyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, written by Gallagher &amp; Lyle then signed to Apple Publishing\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬ËœFields Of St. EtienneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ / previously unreleased version of this Gallagher &amp; Lyle song, the cancelled single, Apple 16 --This text refers to an alternate Audio CD edition.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4322e1e5531f2457911e3683c20447c7802723b","amp;dn":"Mary+Hopkin+-+Post+Card+%281969%2F2010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4322e1e5531f2457911e3683c20447c7802723b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,50,46,30,85,49,242,69,121,17,227,104,60,32,68,124,120,2,114,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
