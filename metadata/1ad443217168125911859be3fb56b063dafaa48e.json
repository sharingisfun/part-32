Before the war is over, Germany will produce a series of technological firsts that remain the basis for many modern day air and spacecraft from a stealth-like trans-Atlantic bomber, to the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first cruise missile. \n\n\nNow, seventy years later, secret Nazi files reveal the classified blueprints for these and many other devastating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Wonder WeaponsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. This documentary reveals the circumstances scientists faced under HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s National Socialist party, and tracks amazing technological innovations from the beginning of the Third Reich through the modern postwar period. It highlights major scientific disciplines and designs, and the inventions of Wernher von Braun, Alexander Lippisch, Irene Bredt, Viktor Schauberger and Werner Heisenberg, among others.\n\n\nThis documentary reveals the circumstances scientists faced under HitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s National Socialist party, and tracks amazing technological innovations from the beginning of the Third Reich through the modern postwar period.
