Cheap Shots, Youth Anthems is a collection of rarities and liner note reminiscences from the bandmembers. The band's hardcore energy and frenzied approach is evident throughout the 29 tracks. There are four &quot;classic&quot; cuts taken from the band's two albums; five covers, including a rip-roaring &quot;Hateful&quot; by the Clash and tracks by Black Flag (&quot;Rise Above&quot;), the Circle Jerks (&quot;Deny Everything&quot;), Minor Threat (&quot;I Don't Wanna Hear About It&quot;), and the Dead Kennedys (&quot;Macho Insecurity&quot;); six songs that were singer Jason Shevchuk's audition for the band; seven demo outtakes (four of which were for songs that ended up on its first record); and seven songs recorded on 94 WYSP radio in Philadelphia. The disc also comes with a bonus DVD filled with live footage, show flyers, and other stuff. It is always nice when a band breaks up to have a disc that gathers up all the loose ends. When done right, it can ease the sting of loss for the fans and bring a sense of closure. Jade Tree and Kid Dynamite have done it right. Extra points for the hilarious tribute to the Who's Odds &amp; Sods on the CD's cover.\n(review from allmusic.com by Tim Sendra)\n\n\n01 - Heart A Tact.mp3\n02 - Breakin' A Memory.mp3\n03 - Give'em The Ripped One.mp3\n04 - Two For Flinching.mp3\n05 - Rise Above.mp3\n06 - Deny Everything.mp3\n07 - Hateful.mp3\n08 - I Don't Wanna Hear It.mp3\n09 - Macho Insecurities.mp3\n10 - Showoff.mp3\n11 - Sweet Shop Syndicate.mp3\n12 - Never Met The Gooch.mp3\n13 - Fuckuturn.mp3\n14 - Scary Smurf.mp3\n15 - The Ronald Miller Story.mp3\n16 - Bookworm (Demo).mp3\n17 - The Unheard Chorus (Demo).mp3\n18 - 32 Frames Per Second (Demo).mp3\n19 - Wrist Rocket (Demo).mp3\n20 - News At 11 (Demo).mp3\n21 - Death &amp; Taxes (Demo).mp3\n22 - S.O.S.
