Beat It (Bonus Track)\n\nREVIEW\nthe more I listen to it, the better it gets. I'll be honest and say perhaps the only slightly tedious track is &quot; I don't care &quot; but that's probably because i've heard it the most.\nPatrick Stump has further widened his vocal expression, to me his voice is almost like a unique instrument, adding depth over the top of the grungy guitar on tracks like &quot;American Sweethearts&quot;.\nMy favourite track has to be &quot;Headfirst slide into Cooperstown on a bad bet&quot;, there's definitely some late 80's rock influence in there with the rhythm, synth and drumming, hard to describe but it's so catchy! Then you've got tracks like &quot;w.a.m.s&quot; and &quot;Tiffany blews&quot; with help from Pharrel and Lil' Wayne (that show an eagerness to prove they can still produce a different sound and they pull it off), the totally anthemic &quot;Coffee's for closers&quot;, and the fantastic contrasts in the slower &quot;What a catch, Donnie&quot;.\nPeople should forget about calling them sellouts, as far as I see it, they've broadened their spectrum from the simple but catchy pop-punk to something deeper both musically and lyrically, this album is like food for the ears! Maybe once in a while people should actually think about the meaning behind the lyrics in a song, and this would be a good place to start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f628cffce3dffa5ecd0379651e460d9e8c5419","amp;dn":"Fall+Out+Boy+-+Folie+A+Deux+%282008%29+-+P0w3rp0t1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f628cffce3dffa5ecd0379651e460d9e8c5419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,246,40,207,252,227,223,250,94,205,3,121,101,30,70,13,158,140,84,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
