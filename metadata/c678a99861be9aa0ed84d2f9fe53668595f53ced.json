Despite a relatively small recorded output which included a self-titled EP, a split ten-inch with Boy's Life and an appearance on the (Don't Forget to) Breathe compilation, the group quickly earned legendary status in emo circles, and remains a major influence on up-and-coming artists. Following the completion of the Stereo record, however, Christie Front Drive disbanded in May of 1996, with a handful of posthumous releases and reissues appearing in the years to follow. Begin and Marschall later reunited in the Blue Ontario, while Richter formed Antarctica.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c678a99861be9aa0ed84d2f9fe53668595f53ced","amp;dn":"Christie+Front+Drive+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c678a99861be9aa0ed84d2f9fe53668595f53ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,120,169,152,97,190,154,160,237,132,210,249,254,83,102,133,149,245,60,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
