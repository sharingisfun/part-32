These are CD&amp;#039;s bought over the years in shops and at gig&amp;#039;s, as well as a couple of downloads.\n\nFor those of you only familiar with the post-soprano&amp;#039;s fame of A3, you&amp;#039;ve missed out on 15 years of madness, I have been into A3 since they  were performing with gogo dancers and neon pink syringes onstage, since Larry Love would run on singing &amp;#039;Cocaine Killed My Community&amp;#039; under the guise of &amp;#039;Semtex The Urban Terrorist&amp;#039;.  The roots of this band extend all the way from the dirty streets of Brixton, back to the Long March and all the way back to Johnny Cash and the Delta blues.\n\nI have seen them play live more than any other band, indeed they have let me get in free to sound checks and performances in the past.  They are cracking, very intelligent musicians who have a message, indeed D.Wayne Love has met Willam Burroughs when the latter lived in London.  \n\nThey have been honing their weird craft for years and only those with true grit will get to the bottom of what they are about.\n\nIncluded:\nExile on Coldhabour Lane\nLa Peste\nPower in the Blood\nOutlaw\nM.O.R\n\nLast Train to Mashville Volumes 1 &amp; 2  \n\nLive in Dublin\n\nA Variety of Singles including many great B-Sides and remixes\n\nZero Tolerance and A3 Remixes albums that are gig only releases.\n \nEnjoy. I also have the A3 Live DVD and will upload that in due course.\n\n\nAnd remember  &quot;Whatever you fuck your brain with it&amp;#039;s a lie...it&amp;#039;s a god damn lie.&quot;\n\n\nwww.alabama3.co.uk\n\nwww.freeA3.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a405641cfff1f9cb1bd0d5ed56b5928458dd867b","amp;dn":"Alabama+3+-+I+Got+the+Cure....You+Want+It%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a405641cfff1f9cb1bd0d5ed56b5928458dd867b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,5,100,28,255,241,249,203,27,208,213,237,86,181,146,132,88,221,134,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
