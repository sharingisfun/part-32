This package was built using ArchLinux and also tested on Ubuntu 10.04, it should work properly on any Linux distribution with wine installed.\n\nTo install the game run InstallerPhotoshopCS5.sh. This will extract the archive to ~/.wine/wineprefixes/PhotoshopCS5. \n\nTo launch the programs you can either use the desktop icon or execute the script located in ~/bin, either by double clicking on it, or from a terminal enter: ~/bin/PhotoshopCS5Launcher.sh\n\nTo uninstall delete the PhotoshopCS5 folder in ~/.wine/wineprefixes.\n\nI encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other applications and games.\n\nI also encourage you to repackage CorkScrews into distro specific packages\nor add Desktop Environment friendly buttons or whatever other frilly shit you\nlike.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cc4bffb4979cccf6094adf073594c746326221","amp;dn":"CorkScrew+Adobe+PhotoShop+CS5+%28LINUX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17cc4bffb4979cccf6094adf073594c746326221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,204,75,255,180,151,156,204,246,9,74,223,7,53,148,199,70,50,98,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
