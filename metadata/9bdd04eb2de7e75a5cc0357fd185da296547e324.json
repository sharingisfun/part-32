Therefore, the mind devoted to their welfare is like a wish-fulfilling jewel, the source of all happiness and everything good and useful in the world. Just as a farmer who possesses an extremely fertile field, where everything he plants always grows, is very happy to have it and cherishes and takes great care of it, we should feel the same way about other sentient beings--that they are extremely valuable, and cherish and take care of them.\n\n&quot;It is interesting that, whether we are Buddhist or not, if we think about the great kindness of all beings it will be evident that all our happiness does indeed depend upon them.&quot;\n\nIn this book, Khensur Rinpoche Geshe Jampa Tegchok explains how we can train our mind away from self-cherishing, the cause of all suffering, and develop compassion, the cause of everything that is good. He bases his explanation on Kadampa Geshe Chekawa?s classic text, the Seven Point Mind Training, which, amongst other things, teaches us how to transform problems into happiness. \n\n(Uploaded through the kind permission of)          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.lamayeshe.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.lamayeshe.com&lt;/a&gt;\n***********************************************************************************\n*                                                                                 *\n*  *LYWA      *LYWA*      *LYWA* *LYWA   *LYWA   *LYWA    *LYWA   *LYWA*          *\n*   LYWA        LYWA      LYWA    LYWA    LYWA    LYWA     LYWA    *LYWA*         *\n*   LYWA         LYWA    LYWA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA     LYWA    *L.Y.WA*        *\n*   LYWA          LYWA  LYWA       LYWA     LYWA LYWA     LYWA    LYWALYWA        *\n*   LYWA           LYWALYWA         LYWA    LYWALYWA     LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA            L.Y.WA          LYWA     L.Y.WA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWA    LYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWALYWALYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA   L.Y.W.A   LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA  LYWA LYWA *LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              LYWALYWA   LYWALYWA    LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              L.Y.W.A    L.Y.W.A     LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA               LYWA*      LYWA*     LYWA          LYWA   *\n*  ~LYWA*LYWA*LYWA* ~LYWA~              LYWA       LYWA     ~LYWA~        ~LYWA~  *\n*                                                                                 *\n*      ~LAMA~      *      ~YESHE~       *      ~WISDOM~      *      ~ARCHIVE~     *\n*                                                                                 *\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive (LYWA) is the collected works of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Kyabje Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The Archive was founded in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, its spiritual director, to make available in various ways the teachings it contains. Publication of books of edited teachings for free distribution is one of the ways.\n\nPlease visit http://www.lamayeshe.com for HEAPS of Dharma material\n\nLama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche began teaching at Kopan Monastery, Nepal, in 1970. Since then, their teachings have been recorded and transcribed. At present we have more than 10,000 hours of digital audio and some 60,000 pages of raw transcript on our computers. Many recordings, mostly teachings by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, remain to be transcribed, and as Rinpoche continues to teach, the number of recordings in the Archive increases accordingly. Most of our transcripts have been neither checked nor edited.\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. We are a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible, non-profit corporation dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings and totally dependent upon your donations for our continued existence.
