Rich in literary delights, filled with spectacular wordplay, and rife with the bawdy humor of ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comedies, Tomato Rhapsody is the almost-true tale of how the tomato came to ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â€at once a brilliantly inventive fable of love, lust, and longing, and a dazzling feast for the imagination.\n\nThis is a story born from loveÃ¢â‚¬â€a forbidden loveÃ¢â‚¬â€between Davido, an Ebreo tomato farmer, and Mari, a beautiful Catholic girl.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only Davido and Mari who have secrets of the heart. Everyone around them yearns for somethingÃ¢â‚¬â€from DavidoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandfather, who tenderly cultivates the tomato plant he stole on his voyages with Columbus, to MariÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s villainous stepfather, whose eye is trained on his stepdaughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virginity and his neighborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s land.\n\nCaught in the midst of these passions and machinations is a village full of eccentrics who speak in rhyme, celebrate the Feast of the Drunken Saint, and live a life untouched by the passage of time. The schemes and dreams of these men and women are about to change as what is forbidden becomes too delicious to resist. Tradition, religion, and good taste collide unforgettably in a story about the courage to pursue love and tomato sauce at all costs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940e7f6764a5407acaffd8c21b7d861206720f88","amp;dn":"Tomato+Rhapsody+by+Adam+Schell+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940e7f6764a5407acaffd8c21b7d861206720f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,14,127,103,100,165,64,122,202,255,216,194,27,125,134,18,6,114,15,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
