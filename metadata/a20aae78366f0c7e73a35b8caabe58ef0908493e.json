Dinman\nGenre: General and Literary Fiction\nFormat: PDF, ePub, mobi\n\nSynopsis\nThey say that sex sells. But when Max Cohen takes a job in a Pittsburgh ad agency he learns that sex kills too. Max is hired to work on the account for a multinational steel corporation, but when the client fires the agency, he finds himself on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Muffler KingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ account, promoting a local chain of muffler and auto service centers. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t long before Max learns that Big Jim King, founder and president of Muffler King, is a sexual voyeur who uses the agency to source young subjects for his sexual escapades. Max must carefully negotiate big JimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Desires, the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need to keep Muffler King as a client, and the advances of Kitty Wells, Muffler KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marketing manager and Big JimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duplicitous lover. The Ad Game is a both rollicking look at the world of advertising and a cautionary tale of uncontrolled appetites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a20aae78366f0c7e73a35b8caabe58ef0908493e","amp;dn":"The+Ad+Game+by+Joshua+D.+Dinman+%5BVM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a20aae78366f0c7e73a35b8caabe58ef0908493e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,10,174,120,54,111,12,126,115,163,91,140,170,190,88,239,9,8,73,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
