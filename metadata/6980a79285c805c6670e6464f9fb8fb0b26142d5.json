Well, you even do not need to install Windows. Just download WinOnX and you are ready to go within 2 minutes. \nPLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:\n\n- WinOnX should only be used for applications which are not available for OSX. Whenever an application is available for OSX, we strongly recommend to use this version.\n\n- In case your application does not work with WinOnX please drop us a note at http://winonx.com/feedback. We always try to improve the quality based upon your feedback.\n\n- Currently full screen applications (especially games) are only limited supported. We are currently working on a version which will support both full screen for Snow Leopard as well as for Lion.\n\n- WinOnX is based on the open source Wine project. It is a layer which redirects the communication between an application and Windows to OSX. As a result not all applications are fully compatible. Most applications run fine, some run even faster but also some run slower or even crash. \nYou can look at http://appdb.winehq.org/ to get some information how good your application might work with WinOnX which is an ongoing project. In case your Windows application does not work at the moment, there is a good chance that it will work after one of the next updates.\n\nWhat's New in Version 1.3.1\n- Added &quot;File&quot; menu for native OSX support to create multiple windows and open files\n- Update to 'Wine 1.4'\n- Improved 'Support Center'\n- Several bug fixes\n\nNew In Version 1.2:\n- WinOnX Support Center for automatic problem analysis \n- Programs are started with a double click of the mouse \n- Several languages are supported within the program \n- Better support for multiple printers \n- Improvement of full-screen view \n- Crashes are kept under better surveillance \n- Log files for every program \n- Many minor bug fixes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6980a79285c805c6670e6464f9fb8fb0b26142d5","amp;dn":"WinOnX+1.3.1+Cracked+from+Mac+App+Store","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6980a79285c805c6670e6464f9fb8fb0b26142d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,128,167,146,133,200,5,198,103,14,100,100,249,251,143,176,178,97,66,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
