This 1971 live date comes from a Munich nightclub, with a respectfully audience that saves its raucous applause until the conclusion of each number. With bassist George Mraz and drummer Joe Nay along for the ride, Montoliu opens with a thunderous take of &quot;Sweet Georgia Fame,&quot; followed by an introspective treatment of the sentimental ballad &quot;Old Folks.&quot; He's also a convincing blues player, as heard in his up-tempo &quot;Blues,&quot; though the rhythm section is put to the test to keep up with his furious pace. Montoliu is at his most lyrical during his unaccompanied introduction to &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,&quot; even if he adds a bit of Art Tatum-like flashiness. A brisk rendition of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; and warm performance of J.J. Johnson's &quot;Lament&quot; round out this highly recommended CD. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01.
