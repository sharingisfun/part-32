MailerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reincarnated protagonist is carried through the exquisite gardens of the royal harem, along the majestic flow of the Nile, and into the terrifying clash of battle. An extraordinary work of inventiveness, Ancient Evenings lives on in the mind long after the last page has been turned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a31e2702e06fc15f9eef07905e7ebca7b001aa","amp;dn":"Ancient+Evenings+by+Norman+Mailer+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a31e2702e06fc15f9eef07905e7ebca7b001aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,163,30,39,2,224,111,193,95,158,239,7,144,94,126,188,167,176,1,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
