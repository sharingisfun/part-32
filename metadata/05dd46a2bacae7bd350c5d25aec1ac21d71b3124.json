The Avengers are the Marvel UniverseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premiere team working with government approval. Despite their awesome powers, the general public adores them. On the other hand, the X-Men are feared by the very people theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve sworn to protect and are usually hunted by government.\n\nThe X-Men and Avengers race to recover the fragments of MagnetoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former asteroid base that have fallen out of orbit (destroyed by Warlock's dramatic crash landing.) The Soviet Super Soldiers, who want Magneto brought in to face Soviet justice, enter the fray and an all-out, three-way battle erupts.\n\nThe X-Men escape with Magneto, who has rediscovered one of his old helmets that will allow him to wipe mutant prejudice from human minds. The Avengers prevent him from doing so and Magneto surrenders himself. Magneto then decides to use the helmet against the Chief Justice of the Tribunal, who is trying to promote a mutant-human war. The charges against Magneto are dropped. However, MagnetoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan backfires as the general public cries foul and tensions between mutants and humans increase.\n\nThis miniseries was unusual because it was not written by Chris Claremont, who had seemingly written every other X-Men special and miniseries in the 1980s. The overall story is well-balanced regarding the attention paid to both teams. Roger Stern neatly handles all the characters and plot lines. The characters are not lost in all of the action. It was nice to see a variety of reactions to MagnetoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent change of heart, even among the X-Men.\n\nStern wanted to have the story end with Magneto showing himself for the bastard he really was. This plot was changed at the last minute by the series editor.\n \nNOTE:  These are not my scans.  All praise and glory to the original scanners (and authors/artists/publishers,) please.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05dd46a2bacae7bd350c5d25aec1ac21d71b3124","amp;dn":"The+X-Men+vs.+The+Avengers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05dd46a2bacae7bd350c5d25aec1ac21d71b3124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,221,70,162,186,202,231,189,53,12,93,37,174,193,172,33,215,27,49,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
