It seems that Elvis was &quot;on fire&quot; when he played Southern states, no matter if it was 1970 or 1976. His three dates at the Omni Coliseum were special ones and Elvis tried hard to please a very appreciative audience. On this CD, STRAIGHT ARROW is presenting the first concert, as both June 5 and 6 have already been released by other labels.\n\n Elvis hit the Omni stage in a good mood and a strong voice. As usual, the highlights are not only ballad performances like &quot;You Gave Me A Mountain&quot;, a double &quot;Hurt&quot; or even the country gospel of &quot;Help Me&quot; but also rockers like &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot;, &quot;Burning Love&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. Near the end of show, Elvis takes an audience request and belts out one of his best versions of &quot;that silly song&quot;, &quot;Little Darlin'&quot;.\n\n As you've come to expect from Straight Arrow, the producers managed to get the finest possible source: a first-generation copy of an original STEREO audience recording, with the tape completely restored for extremely enjoyable listening.\n This disc is topped off with a 16-page booklet, including a fine collection of photos from Atlanta on June 4th and 5th, and liner notes.\n\n You will be more than surprised by the sound and, most importantly, by Elvis himself.\n Yes, he had some off-moments in 1976, but this gig ain't one of them! Don't miss a chance to dig another cool show from the King.\n \n \n  Concert:\n \n   The best out of the 3 Atlanta shows Elvis gave in June 1976. He was in good spirits and tried hard to please his adored Atlanta crowd. His voice was strong as ever. The stereo effect is great and even enhances the good sound. Recommendable ! (Ciscoking) \n\n\nEnjoy!\njeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6764aced9749172471cad79cf639ce157bb556f9","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Atlanta+Bound+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6764aced9749172471cad79cf639ce157bb556f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,100,172,237,151,73,23,36,113,202,215,156,246,57,206,21,123,181,86,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
