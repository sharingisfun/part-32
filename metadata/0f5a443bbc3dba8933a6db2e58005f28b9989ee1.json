Im Hogutz\n\nAndrew Cronshaw is a bravely experimental British composer and multi-instrumentalist who is also a journalist. His last album, the much-praised Ochre, released seven years ago, matched English folk melodies against Middle Eastern instrumentation. Here he is joined by three other musicians, including Tigran Aleksanyan, a master of the Armedian duduk, for drifting and mostly instrumental compositions that include echoes of British or Armenian traditional melodies. Three tracks are duets with Aleksanyan, with Cronshaw playing the gently chiming zither, whistles, pipes or the enormous Slovak fujara flute. There's a solo zither treatment of a stirring Scottish traditional melody, and the remarkable 34-minute title track, based on a Finnish creation myth, on which zither and duduk are joined by clarinet, saxophone and singer Sanna Kurki-Suonio, apparently improvising the melody that suddenly enlivens this delicate, haunting exercise in glacial mood music.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2012/01/08/andrew-cronshaw/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5a443bbc3dba8933a6db2e58005f28b9989ee1","amp;dn":"Andrew+Cronshaw...The+Unbroken+Surface+of+Snow%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5a443bbc3dba8933a6db2e58005f28b9989ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,90,68,59,188,61,186,137,51,166,219,46,88,0,95,40,185,152,158,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
