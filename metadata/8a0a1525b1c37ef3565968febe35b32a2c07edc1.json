Sheer magic under Le Van's hands, these performances are utterly heart-wrenching. Le Van is a master of nuance and inflection, indispensable to a great Scriabin performance. Here one finds an all-too-rare understanding of Scriabin's unique multifarious sound-world, and the interpreter milks these long-neglected gems for all of their poetry and emotional urgency. Compared to this version of the Mazurkas, all others sound pedestrian, with the exception of Samuel Feinberg; but Feinberg only recorded a selection from op.3, whereas here you have the whole set. This is an absolutely must for any record collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a0a1525b1c37ef3565968febe35b32a2c07edc1","amp;dn":"Alexander+Scriabin+-+Complete++Mazurkas+%28Eric+Le+Van%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a0a1525b1c37ef3565968febe35b32a2c07edc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,10,21,37,177,195,126,243,86,89,104,254,190,53,179,42,44,7,237,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
