Oermann, the dean of country critics. &quot;In his voice is all the ache of existence.&quot; In 1974 Watson's steamy single Love In The Hot Afternoon made the Top 10 and ignited a firestorm of hits. Here Gene Watson, a real singer's singer, puts on one of his trademark breath-taking performances. \r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n1. 14 Carat Mind\r\n2. No One Will Ever Know\r\n3. Take Off Them Shoes\r\n4. Speak Softly, Your Talking To My Heart\r\n5. Farewell Party\r\n6. You're Out Doin' What I'm Here Doin' Without\r\n7. Nothing Sure Looks Good On You\r\n8. What She Don't Know Won't Hurt Her\r\n9. Pick The Wildwood Flowers\r\n10. Should I Go Home (Or Should I Go Crazy)\r\n11.
