They were re-named The Mersey Beats in February 1962 by Bob Wooler, MC at the Cavern Club. Later in April 1962 they became The Merseybeats. By now Crane and Kinsley had joined up with guitarist Aaron Williams (born 23 June 1942, Liverpool) and drummer John Banks (born 23 September 1943, Liverpool - died 20 April 1988). They were originally signed to the Brian Epstein organisation, but when Epstein failed to supply The Merseybeats with the same classy suits that he had given The Beatles, they parted company with him, much to their later regret.\n\nThey then signed a record deal with Fontana and had their first hit single in 1963 with &quot;It's Love That Really Counts&quot;, followed in 1964 by their million-selling recording &quot;I Think of You&quot; which gained them their first gold disc. They suffered a setback when in February 1964 Billy Kinsley left to form his own band, The Kinsleys. He was temporarily replaced by Bob Garner (later of The Creation) and permanently by Johnny Gustafson, formerly of The Big Three. With Gustafson they had two more major hits, &quot;Don't Turn Around&quot; and &quot;Wishin' &amp; Hopin'&quot;. Other successful recordings included &quot;Last Night&quot;, &quot;Don't Let it Happen to Us&quot;, &quot;I Love You Yes I Do&quot;, &quot;I Stand Accused&quot;, &quot;Mister Moonlight&quot;, &quot;Really Mystified&quot; and &quot;The Fortune Teller.&quot; Meanwhile Kinsley had returned to the fold late 1964.\n\nThe Merseybeats became well known for their distinctive style of fashion. They were credited as the 'Best Looking Group', dressed in tight-fitting suits with bolero jackets and frilly shirts. Their outfits, complete with high-heeled zip boots, provoked hysteria from their female fans\n\nThey appeared regularly at LiverpoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world famous Cavern Club and they claim to have appeared there with The Beatles on more occasions than any other band from that era. They were also successful abroad, touring in Germany and the U.S. in 1964, and having their own Merseybeats Show on Italian television. &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merseybeats&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merseybeats&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n01.
