Well this book will help you learn how to embrace positive thinking in order to achieve success in your life. So, what makes the difference between someone who seems to get things done, achieve success, and seem to have it all and someone who does not seem to get things done? Well, the one thing that has a huge impact on whether you pursue your dreams or not is your mind. \r\nWhile your mind is a very powerful organ, if you donâ€™t harness its full potential, then you will not live the kind of life you desire. Think about it; when your mind believes that you are already defeated, no amount of practice or training can make you believe otherwise. In fact, even when people keep telling you that you can do it, when your mind thinks you canâ€™t, you wonâ€™t make any significant progress in whatever it is you wanted to do. \r\nSo in essence, the secret to success in life lies in harnessing the power of the mind. If you are fully aware of that but find it hard to use your mindâ€™s unlimited power to unleash your full potential, this book will help you to achieve just that. \r\nIf you are looking for actionable information on how to harness the power of the mind to transform yourself, then this book will teach you how to unleash the full power of your mindset to transform your life. \r\n\r\nThis Is What You'll Discover Inside...\r\n\r\nWhy The Need To Embrace Positive Thinking\r\nChapter 2: How To Develop Positive Mindset: Understanding That You Possess The Ultimate Power Over Yourself\r\nDevelop A Positive Thought Process\r\nAppreciate Yourself\r\nBecome Mindful Of The Negative Thoughts To Eradicate Them\r\nFinding the Good in Every Bad Situation\r\nStep 6- Practicing NLP Techniques For Developing A Positive Mindset\r\nAnd Much, much \r\nmore!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642a5251157f0dc21e1e27c40956368b12162b16","amp;dn":"MINDSET-How+Positive+Thinking+Will+Set+You+Free+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642a5251157f0dc21e1e27c40956368b12162b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,42,82,81,21,127,13,194,30,30,39,196,9,86,54,139,18,22,43,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
