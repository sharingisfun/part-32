The album is widely perceived By fans and critics (and Kim herself) as Wilde&amp;#039;s most well-balanced, with many kinds of pop represented: dance, ballad, rock and midtempo. \nThe album&amp;#039;s lead single was &quot;Hey Mister Heartache&quot;, featuring backing vocals from Junior Giscombe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but its success was dwarfed by the follow-up single, You Came, which hit the Top 10 in many countries and just missed the U.S. Top 40. \n&quot;Never Trust a Stranger&quot; and &quot;Four Letter Word&quot; also reached the UK Top 10, although a fifth single &quot;Love in the Natural Way&quot; was less successful. Attention for the album was bolstered by Kim&amp;#039;s support slot on Michael Jackson&amp;#039;s European tour. \nClose reached the Top 10 in the UK, almost all Scandinavian countries, Austria and Germany and went on to become Wilde&amp;#039;s biggest selling album, being certified platinum in the UK and shifting more than 2 million units worldwide. \n\nTrack listing \n01-&quot;Hey Mister Heartache&quot; \n02-&quot;You Came&quot; \n03-&quot;Four Letter Word&quot; \n04-&quot;Love in the Natural Way&quot; \n05-&quot;Love&amp;#039;s a No&quot; \n06-&quot;Never Trust a Stranger&quot; \n07-&quot;You&amp;#039;ll Be the One Who&amp;#039;ll Lose&quot; \n08-&quot;European Soul&quot; \n09-&quot;Stone&quot; \n10-&quot;Lucky Guy&quot; \n11-&quot;Hey Mister Heartache&quot; (12&quot; version) \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nP.S.
