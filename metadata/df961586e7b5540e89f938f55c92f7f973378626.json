I had no idea where Hubert Kah was coming from singing about a diabolical clown. Then, I did my history research. Without giving any graphic details, the subject matter is about the infamous John Wayne Gacy (a.k.a &quot;Clown Killer&quot;) murder and molestation crimes of the late 60's and early 70's. The song is sung from the viewpoint of Gacy about the male abductions and molestations committed by him. The other track in question with regards to shocking subject matter is That Girl; a love song about a guy's obsession with a dead girl; Can you say necrophilia ? These two songs, lyrically speaking, sound like they came off a Marilyn Manson album. \n\nHowever, the style does not; It's strictly slick late 80's Euro-Pop dance music \nfrom Germany (sung in English) . It's a cross between Howard Jones and Alphaville with a touch of Pet-Shop boys. What is interesting to note is that much of the material was co-written, produced, and instrumentally performed ( keyboards) by Michael Cretu of Enigma fame; If you're wondering, the music sounds nothing like Enigma. As for the other songs, with much less shock value, are also well crafted. \n\nThis album is highly recommended for 80's dance and new wave enthusiasts.\n\n1 Pogo the Clown   3:31 \n2 Lonesome Cowboy   4:06 \n3 Drowning   3:47 \n4 Something I Should Know   3:29 \n5 Explain The World in a Word   4:11 \n6 Love Is So Sensible   3:49 \n7 Get Strange   3:06 \n8 That Girl   3:51 \n9 Limousine   4:02 \n10 Under My Skin   4:23 \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df961586e7b5540e89f938f55c92f7f973378626","amp;dn":"Hubert+Kah+-+Tensongs+%5B1986%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df961586e7b5540e89f938f55c92f7f973378626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,150,21,134,231,181,84,14,137,249,56,245,92,146,247,249,115,55,134,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
