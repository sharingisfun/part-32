It is a compilation of 30 years of quality-related work experience and the result of frustration at the number of books necessary, at times, to provide statistical support. To that end, the intent of this book is to provide the quality professional working in virtually any industry a quick, convenient, and comprehensive guide to properly utilize statistics in an efficient and effective manner.\r\n\r\nThis book will be a useful reference when preparing for and taking many of the ASQ quality certification examinations, including the Certified Quality Technician (CQT), Certified Six Sigma Green Belt (CSSGB), Certified Quality Engineer (CQE), Certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB), and Certified Reliability Engineer (CRE).\r\n\r\nThis book is an expansion of the work of Robert A. Dovich in his books Quality Engineering Statistics and Reliability Statistics. It builds on and expands Dovich's method of presenting statistical applications in a simple, easy-to-follow format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88158dd37c18401242d55390b56ffa98ae71b46","amp;dn":"Practical+Engineering%2C+Process%2C+and+Reliability+Statistics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b88158dd37c18401242d55390b56ffa98ae71b46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,129,88,221,55,193,132,1,36,45,85,57,11,86,255,169,138,231,27,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
