An  epic\n story, cinematically presented, as well as highly detailed characters  and\n exciting, gripping quests are the results of the elaborate production done\n by Silver Style, the in-house development department of TGC  -  The  Games\n Company.\n\n Demonicon narrates an enthralling story about betrayal, intrigues and dark\n powers: Your foster-father is a murderer, an ostracized one. He chased the\n love of your life, intending to coldbloodedly kill her - at least that  is\n what scheming courtiers tell  you,  in  a  time  of  fear,  in  a  country\n bordering the  realm  of  evil:  the  Black  Lands.  But  is  your  loving\n foster-father truly  guilty?  Did  he  really  intend  to  kill  beautiful\n Calandra, daughter of a wealthy alchemist, or is he the victim of  vicious\n slander? Your enemies are numerous and the secretive half-elf  Rynn  seems\n to be your only ally. Your search  for  the  truth  leads  you  into  most\n dangerous regions and deep into the shadows.  It  becomes  more  and  more\n obvious you are  involved  in  events  shaking  the  very  foundations  of\n Aventuria! Your actions decide the fate of the world. On your  quest,  you\n will battle most dangerous  creatures  and  you  will  meet  unforgettable\n allies: madmen, saints, and the desperate. Only you can decide who will be\n your friend, and who will be your enemy - but  choose  wisely!  The  Black\n Lands do not forgive mistakes.\n\n\n Features:\n =========\n\n * True to the original concept of the TDE world and following the\n   original TDE ruleset\n * In the most epic TDE adventure you will have to make decisions,\n   that might strongly influence the world\n * Whether Dwarfes, Half-Elves or Tulamid Summoners: Use the various\n   possibilties of the original TDE ruleset, to create your own\n   individual character\n * Orchestral Soundtrack and professional voice over during the\n   entire game\n * Sophisticated artificial intelligence in cooperation with a\n   realistic day-night cylce makes the world feel alive\n * Enhanced gameplay experience via various multiplayer modes - for\n   the first time ever in a TDE game\n\n\n Installation Information:\n =========================\n\n * Burn or mount\n * Install\n * Play the game\n\n NOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n                                                             /TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n\n                    +-+  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE +-+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ceadb19a867d32d5b6a0117832fc37b64322d3","amp;dn":"Demonicon_PROPER-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ceadb19a867d32d5b6a0117832fc37b64322d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,206,173,177,154,134,125,50,213,182,160,17,120,50,252,55,182,67,34,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
