Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61589fadde02ebec52a876b59b558aed4ebb8d4f","amp;dn":"FamilyStrokes+Trisha+Parks+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61589fadde02ebec52a876b59b558aed4ebb8d4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,88,159,173,222,2,235,236,82,168,118,181,155,85,138,237,78,187,141,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
