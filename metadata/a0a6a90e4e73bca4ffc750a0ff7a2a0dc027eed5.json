Burrough&amp;#039;s novel but a mix of biography and an interpretation of his drug- induced writing processes combined with elements of his work in this paranoid fantasy about Bill Lee, a writer who accidentally shoots his wife, whose typewriter transforms into a cockroach and who becomes involved in a mysterious plot in an Islamic port called Interzone. Wonderfully bizarre, not unlike Burrough&amp;#039;s books.\n\nExterminator Bill Lee finds himself following his wife into an addiction to the bug powder he uses. After accidentally killing her, he descends into a hallucinatory existence in which he imagines himself a secret agent answering to a series of bizarre creatures. He channels his energies into writing &quot;reports&quot; on his delusional mission, while trying to break his addiction. The story loosely reflects events in the life of author Burroughs as he wrote the novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0a6a90e4e73bca4ffc750a0ff7a2a0dc027eed5","amp;dn":"Naked+Lunch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0a6a90e4e73bca4ffc750a0ff7a2a0dc027eed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,166,169,14,78,115,188,164,255,199,80,160,255,122,42,13,192,39,238,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
