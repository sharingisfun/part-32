Captain Jim Wedderburn has looks, style and courage by the bucketful. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adored by women, respected by men and feared by his enemies. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the man to find out who has twisted London into this strange new world, and he knows it. But the towers are growing taller, the parks have hidden themselves away and the streets form themselves into strange new patterns. There are people sailing in from new lands down the river, new criminals emerging in the East End and a path spiralling down to another world. Everyone is changing, no one is who they seem to be, and Captain Jim Wedderburn is beginning to understand that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the man he thought he was...\n \nAbout The Author\n \nTony Ballantyne is the author of Twisted Metal, Blood and Iron and the Recursion series.
