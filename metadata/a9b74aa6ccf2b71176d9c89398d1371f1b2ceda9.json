When Ashleigh was hired to voice Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash for Hasbro's fourth series to use the My Little Pony name - My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - she had no idea she would become an Internet phenomenon and major celebrity to a worldwide fan-base of grownups. Bronies are united by their belief in the show's philosophy. This documentary gives an inside view of the Pony fan-world, and an intimate look at the courage it takes to just be yourself...even when that means liking a little girls' cartoon.\n\n===============\n\nI couldn't include the Bonus Features, but that's for you if you buy the DVD, so...\n\nPlease support the authors of this film by buying the movie via DVD or iTunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b74aa6ccf2b71176d9c89398d1371f1b2ceda9","amp;dn":"A+Brony+Tale+-+H.264+%28DVD+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b74aa6ccf2b71176d9c89398d1371f1b2ceda9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,183,74,166,204,242,183,17,118,217,200,147,152,209,55,31,27,44,237,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
