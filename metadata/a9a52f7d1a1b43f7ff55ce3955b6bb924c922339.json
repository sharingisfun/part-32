Stunning aerial footage, high-definition video and real-time satellite data reveal the American landscape as you've never seen it before, and host Yul Kwon climbs, leaps, and rides across the US to find out what makes this nation tick .. He traces the mighty infrastructures that miraculously come together to manufacture goods, transport people, grow our food, and power our increasingly tech-dependent nation. From the glaciers of Alaska to the crowded New York subways; from Chicago's bustling freight yards to the lonely badlands of Wyoming, Yul takes us to spectacular and unexpected places and introduces us to the people whose effort and expertise puts food on our tables, keeps our lights on, our transport systems moving and our factories busy. This is a celebration of a nation in the 21st century. This is AMERICA REVEALED.\n\nEpisode 1: Food Machine\n\nHow America keeps pace with its insatiable appetite. The story of how a revolution in food production turned deserts into orchards, prairies into a bread basket, and created the biggest food machine in the world.\n\nEpisode 2: Nation on the Move\n\nAmericans are the most mobile people on earth and their transport systems are the biggest and most complex. From the rural school bus to the busiest airport, we explore the vast infrastructure that keeps Americans on the move.\n\nEpisode 3: Electric Nation\n\nWe take electricity for granted but how is it generated and how does our vast but aging grid get it to every house, office and factory in the nation?\n\nEpisode 4: Made in the U.S.A.\n\nThis is the story of how American manufacturers embraced new ideas and technologies to transform themselves into world leading producers of everything from sleek new cars to mighty ships to microchips.\n\n\n\nS C R E E N S :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aaprhrIM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aaprhrIM&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aavwdwgx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aavwdwgx&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aayFiEkj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aayFiEkj&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aauIdnfk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aauIdnfk&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aan64qJU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/aan64qJU&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a52f7d1a1b43f7ff55ce3955b6bb924c922339","amp;dn":"America+Revealed+2012+720p+BluRay+x264-DON+%5BPublicHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a52f7d1a1b43f7ff55ce3955b6bb924c922339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,165,47,125,26,27,67,247,255,85,206,57,85,182,187,146,76,146,35,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
