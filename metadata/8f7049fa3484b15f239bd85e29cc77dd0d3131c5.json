It was an emerald green gown, a green hat, and a green silk veil that hung over her face to disguise her identity. She solved blackmail cases, spy cases, kidnappings, and any other cases that came her way. As Brenda Banks, she was in love with Police Chief Hardy Moore; ironically, Moore's job was to bring in Lady Luck.\n\n\nReal Name\nBrenda Banks\n\nFirst Appearance\nSmash Comics #42 (1940)\n\nOriginal Publisher\nQuality Comics\n\nCreated by\nWill Eisner, Dick French and Chuck Mazoujian\n\n\nSeed for all to enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f7049fa3484b15f239bd85e29cc77dd0d3131c5","amp;dn":"Lady+Luck+Archive+COMPLETE+Will+Eisner+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f7049fa3484b15f239bd85e29cc77dd0d3131c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,112,73,250,52,132,177,95,35,155,216,94,41,204,119,221,13,49,49,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
