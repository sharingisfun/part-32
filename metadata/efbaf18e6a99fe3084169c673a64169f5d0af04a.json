Balkan Turbo Folk?  Middle Eastern Dance Music?  New wave Lyrical Electro?  All that and more no doubt, contribute to an avant-garde musical manifesto that is held together by an impressively rich soundscape, a sublime hymn to love as much as a fantastical psychedelic trip; we stand on the cusp of a brave new world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efbaf18e6a99fe3084169c673a64169f5d0af04a","amp;dn":"YOM+-++The+Empire+of+Love+%282013%29++%5BJazz+Klezmer%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efbaf18e6a99fe3084169c673a64169f5d0af04a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,186,241,142,106,153,254,48,132,22,156,103,58,100,22,159,93,10,240,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
