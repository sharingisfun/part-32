Only the Law Lords now stand \nbetween the Scot and a US trial for allegedly breaking into and damaging 97 US government computers between 2001 and 2002 and \ncausing an estimated $700,000 worth of damage, in what US authorities have described as the &quot;biggest military&quot; computer hack ever.\n\nThe former sys admin admits he gained unauthorised access to military networks - using a Perl script to search for default passwords - \nbut describes himself as a bumbling amateur motivated by curiosity about evidence of UFOs, rather than a cyberterrorist. McKinnon \nand his legal team have consistently argued that he ought to be tried in the UK.\n\nThe Law Lords agreed to hear arguments that US authorities acted in an &quot;oppressive&quot; and &quot;arbitrary&quot; manner during plea bargaining \nnegotiations, for example, by allegedly threatening McKinnon over the loss of rights to serve part of his sentence in the UK unless he \nsubmitted to voluntary extradition. No date for the hearing has been set as yet.&quot;\n\n45 minutes - mp3\n\nDirected by Pete Atkin.\n\n==\n\nBest Viewed with !DAMN!
