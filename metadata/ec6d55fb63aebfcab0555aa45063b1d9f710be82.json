He was born Johnny Jones in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, and started singing professionally in the late 1940s. He befriended Fats Domino and, whilst working together, was given his nickname by Domino. \n\nJones was employed as the vocalist by a New Orleans based band led by the brothers, David and Melvin Lastie, until the late 1960s. Jones also had regular employment at a sugar factory. He returned to the recording studio in 1975, and issued his album, New Orleans R&amp;B Gems, initially on the Netherlands based Black Magic label. With contributions from veteran musicians including Dave 'Fat Man' Williams, the record faithfully copied the R&amp;B style and sound of the 1950s.
