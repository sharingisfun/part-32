It is being developed by veterans of Iron Lore entertainment, the          Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ makers  of Titan Quest. Grim Dawn is being built with Crate's own improved         Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ version of  the Iron Lore engine and toolset; the same technology used to          Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ create Titan Quest.  As a spiritual successor, Grim Dawn will attempt to better    Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ perfect the magical  formula of exploration, character advancement, and loot       Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ collection pioneered  by Diablo.

Cairn has become ground zero of an eternal war between two            Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ otherworldly powers,  one seeking to use human bodies as a resource, the other     Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ intent upon destroying the  human race before that can happen. This cataclysmic    Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ war has not only decimated human  civilization but is warping the very fabric      Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ of reality and, in its wake, giving life  to new horrors.

Small enclaves of human survivors exist scattered throughout       Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ the world,  holed up in hidden refuges. These humans have quietly watched the      Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ warring invaders  destroy one another and have become wise to the strengths and    Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ vulnerabilities of  their otherworldly foes. A few survivors have begun to         Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ exhibit strange new abilities  after surviving possession or exposure to the       Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ warp. These unnatural powers are feared  by some but give many new hope of         Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ launching a resistance to fight the &quot;outsiders&quot; and  reclaim what's left of        Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ their world.                                                                       \n                      :: Ã‚Â° Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ÃƒÅ¾Ãƒï¿½        KEY FEATURES       ÃƒÅ¾Ãƒï¿½ÃƒÅ¾Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â° Ã‚Â° ::\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ * Combine any of five distinct skill classes each with multiple skill trees in     Ã‚Â²Ã‚Â²\n Ã‚Â²Ãƒï¿½ which to specialize.
