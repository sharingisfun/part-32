Play as an independent Count on any start date and battle against all others for world dominance! \n\nFor CK2 version 2.1.6\n\n~~~CHANGELOG~~~ \n5.0.1 (2014-JUN-04) Unbroke wars of aggression, doubled cost, made mutually aggressive. Unbroke tool tips. \n5.0.0 (2014-MAY-30) All counts are now generated. Added 2 CBs: a cultural &quot;holy&quot; war and a fast and cheap form of &quot;Fabricate Claim&quot; which you need .5 scaled wealth to use. Updated to 2.1.5. Now compatible with mods which modify the defines.lua. Fixed 2 bugs: generated counts not always being the correct religion and culture; generated count names with ANSI characters getting messed up. \nFor more history, see ChangeLog.txt.
