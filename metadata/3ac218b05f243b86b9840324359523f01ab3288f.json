A few of the disc's cuts are pleasantly catchy, but too much of its space is given over to icky ballads (&quot;E-Mail My Heart&quot;?) and other unconvincing moves such as the dancehall-lite &quot;Soda Pop.&quot; --Rickey Wright.\n\nTracks:\n\n1 - ...Baby One More Time\n2 - (You Drive Me) Crazy\n3 - Sometimes\n4 - Soda Pop\n5 - Born to Make You Happy\n6 - From The Bottom of my Broken Heart\n7 - I Will Be There\n8 - I Will Still Love You (feat. Don Phillip)\n9 - Thinkin' About You\n10 - E-mail my Heart\n11 - The Beat Goes On\n\nOn Apple Lossless format. Ripped with iTunes. Enjoy!! \nThank you for Download.
