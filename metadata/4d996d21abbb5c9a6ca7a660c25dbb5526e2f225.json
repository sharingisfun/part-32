This album is a melting pot of everything that is related to progressive rock: Hammond organ, Mellotron, Mini-Moog, extended instrumental passages, a brilliant concept story and top quality songs...The musicians are very talented, and Fred Schendel is without doubt one of the finest keyboard players around today in the progressive genre. Arjen Lucassen of AYREON is doing a guest appearance on this album playing additional lead guitars. The music is firmly rooted in the ?70?s progressive rock. Musical reminiscences that springs to mind are EMERSON, LAKE &amp; PALMER, The FLOWER KINGS, GENESIS, NATHAN MAHL, PINK FLOYD, SPOCK&amp;#039;S BEARD, TRANSATLANTIC and YES.\n\n1.
