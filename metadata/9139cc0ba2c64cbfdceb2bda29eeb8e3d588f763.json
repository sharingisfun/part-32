Here is a &quot;re-seed&quot; and I will ask that the first attempt be deleted.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHarlequin Valentine\nDark Horse Comics/Maverick, 2001\nWritten by Neil Gaiman\nArt by John Bolton\n\n&quot;Harlequin Valentine&quot; is a bloody and romantic short story (1999) and graphic novel (2001) based on the old Commedia dell'arte and Harlequinade pantomime.\n\nBoth the short story and the graphic novel were written by Neil Gaiman.
