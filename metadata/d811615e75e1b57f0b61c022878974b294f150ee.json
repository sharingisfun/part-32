In this installment, Durham shatters the idea that lace is old-fashioned by presenting more than 30 cutting-edge knitting designs that are as up-to-the-minute style-wise as they are thoroughly steeped in lace tradition. The projects cover a wide spectrum, from classic shawls and camisoles that utilize traditional laceweight yarns and revered stitch patterns, to ultramodern pullovers and accessories in bold colors and chunky yarns that showcase lace at a larger scale. Projects range from easy to advanced. Detailed swatch photos throughout illuminate the stitchwork, while color fashion photos show off the finished garments with the series' signature modern, romantic appeal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d811615e75e1b57f0b61c022878974b294f150ee","amp;dn":"Loop-d-Loop+Lace%3A+More+Than+30+Novel+Lace+Designs+for+Knitters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d811615e75e1b57f0b61c022878974b294f150ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,17,97,94,117,225,181,127,11,97,192,34,135,137,116,178,148,241,80,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
