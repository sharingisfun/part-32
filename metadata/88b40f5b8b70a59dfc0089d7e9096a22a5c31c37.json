The story of the migration (an Edmontosaurus herd) is narrated by Stephen Fry.  It is a feature length animation that shows how dinosaurs lived more than seventy million years ago in the Arctic Circle.  To read about the research work that the programme is based upon: Dinosaurs of the Arctic The programme follows the story of two young dinosaurs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Scar, a young vegetarian Edmontosaurus who hatched in the spring, and Patch, a young male feathered, raptor-like Troodon.  As a carnivore, Patch has fed all summer on baby Edmontosaurus.  Unfortunately for him his favourite food is shortly going to be heading south. Troodon like Patch are equipped to cope through the winter and the film follows his stay in the harsh North. It will be survival of the fittest as they fight for the remaining food in the permanent darkness.  Everyone and everything is fair game.  Such scenarios are scene with extant animals today, such as the Arctic Fox which enjoys a time of plenty when the migrating birds arrive and nest, but the foxes face leaner times when the birds leave.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1537 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime per Part  90.mins \nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.02 GB\nSource: DVB-Rip\nEncoded by: Harry65\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b40f5b8b70a59dfc0089d7e9096a22a5c31c37","amp;dn":"March+of+the+Dinosaurs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b40f5b8b70a59dfc0089d7e9096a22a5c31c37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,180,15,91,139,112,165,157,252,0,137,215,233,9,106,34,165,195,28,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
