Also called &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; or occasionally &quot;Rising Sun Blues&quot;, it tells of a life gone wrong in New Orleans. Depending on the version, the song may be sung from the perspective of a woman or a man. Two of the best-known renditions of the song are by the English group The Animals in 1964, which was a number one hit in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, and by Joan Baez in 1959-60.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5126fdd437a5284823e1ed7c44d6ed33d0f02386","amp;dn":"The+Animals+-+House+Of+The+Rising+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5126fdd437a5284823e1ed7c44d6ed33d0f02386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,38,253,212,55,165,40,72,35,225,237,124,68,214,237,51,208,240,35,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
