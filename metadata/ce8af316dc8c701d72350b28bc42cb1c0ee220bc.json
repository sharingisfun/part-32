All we need is a video camera on the roof, plugged into a PC, right? We have all the necessary hardware, and have had it for years, but don't yet have robot-driven cars because we don't have the software. This book explains how we can build better software and all get our own high-tech chauffeur.\n\nKeith Curtis, an 11-year veteran of Microsoft, believes deeply that open source is the future of software.\n\nHe takes a programmerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoftware Wars,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attempting to systematically build a case that software can help pave the way for a 21st-century renaissance in many fields ranging from artificial intelligence (cars that drive themselves) to the human journey into space (space elevators). For Mr. Curtis, open source software is all about leveraging our collective intelligence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce8af316dc8c701d72350b28bc42cb1c0ee220bc","amp;dn":"After+the+Software+Wars+%28May+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce8af316dc8c701d72350b28bc42cb1c0ee220bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,138,243,22,220,140,112,29,114,53,11,40,188,66,203,28,14,226,32,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
