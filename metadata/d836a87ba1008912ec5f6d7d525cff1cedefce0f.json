(2011 - Canada)\r\n\r\nHorror / Romance / Thriller\r\n\r\nRickMoe Productions\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2075109/\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget: $5,000 estimated\r\n\r\nBangin' Vengeance! is trying to tap into the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; market but it falls squarely into the &quot;so bad it's actually bad&quot; camp. It's a horror film about an aspiring actress named Amber Rain who gets a boob job to increase her chances of landing a film role. Her new sweater puppies gain sentience and start telling her to murder people. As her jugs talk to her, with the left and the right having different personalities, she goes on a killing spree. The concept sounds hysterical on paper, but the execution, some reviewers posit, is not good. Note that the bad ADR and the &quot;vintage scratched film stock&quot; filter were deliberate techniques utilized by the director.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 672x288, 29.970 fps, 1309 Kbps, 01h14m10s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jb42yqgpt/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/g917ki4v5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/50n0wpr1d/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9juo4hjj5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/anjdu6tk1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d836a87ba1008912ec5f6d7d525cff1cedefce0f","amp;dn":"Bangin%27+Vengeance%21+%5B2011+-+Canada%5D+low+budget+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d836a87ba1008912ec5f6d7d525cff1cedefce0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,54,168,123,161,0,137,18,236,95,109,125,82,92,255,28,237,239,206,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
