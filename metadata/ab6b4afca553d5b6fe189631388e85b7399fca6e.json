It says a lot about the competition as the Toys hit number two on the charts that very week,\npushing the Supremes, Diana Ross, and the production team of Holland/Dozier/Holland to one of their greatest heights.\nThe re-write of Bach, with its boss production, is a sweeping pop sensation.\nAnd the album\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 14 tracks play like the Ronettes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' first and only official release,\na magnificent statement of vocal harmony and pretty melodies\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t Get Enough Of You...\n2. Deserted\n3. See How They Run\n4. Hallelujah\n5. I Got A Man\n6. A Lover\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Concerto\n7. What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Wrong With Me Ba...\n8.
