There is hope that a brand new concourse will lift everyone's spirits. East Coast manager Steve Newland wants the opening to coincide with customer service levels worthy of a five-star hotel, a vision that is frustrated when broken-down trains and fatalities on the line bring everything to a standstill. Laxman Keshwara has worked at the station for 35 years, during which time he has witnessed both an IRA bombing and the King's Cross fire. He is a much-loved staff member but retirement beckons and is last day at work is a very sad one for everyone at the station.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c81f7b60bb65ab38f8980c10033c1496a65b75","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Railway+Keeping+Britain+on+Track+1of6+Kings+Cross+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c81f7b60bb65ab38f8980c10033c1496a65b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,200,31,123,96,187,101,171,56,248,152,12,16,3,60,20,150,166,91,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
