The selected papers reflect the state-of-the-art of the more advanced theoretical and practical studies in the field of control of complex systems. The contributions provide a comprehensive view on some selected topics of particular importance at the disciplinary borderline between Physics and Control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9c0e8ecdf93f8d0367204900a9bf8258b8d053","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+From+Physics+to+Control+Through+an+Emergent+View+%28W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9c0e8ecdf93f8d0367204900a9bf8258b8d053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,156,14,142,205,249,63,141,3,103,32,73,0,169,191,130,88,184,208,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
