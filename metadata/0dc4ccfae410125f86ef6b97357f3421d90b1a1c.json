Very energetic for 1 man and a guitar. The performance is\nexcellent and the intimacy cant be matched. As the headline reads, it is truly live. You get the in between songs, short rants and an occasional guitar 'off' notes, but I'll tell ya, its a very refreshing and cool disc.\n\nIf you liked any of the 3 discs of Travis Meeks (Days of the New), you will love the feel of this. Its honest with its imperfections, yet the energy and voice make up for it. No one out there has that 'voice' and style of Meeks, I play it often. The sound quality is really good for a low budget release. Pick it up if you like him or if you like live music in general. --  By Dons Word &quot;Don C&quot; VINE VOICE\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Words                                                [05:40]\n02.Freak                                                [06:37]\n03.How do you know you                                  [05:30]\n04.Shelf in the room                                    [05:21]\n05.I think                                              [05:35]\n06.Orch of the medium                                   [06:47]\n07.The down town                                        [04:47]\n08.Solitude                                             [04:51]\n09.Dirty road                                           [06:00]\n10.Enemy                                                [04:43]\n11.Touch, peel, and stand                               [09:03]\n________\n64:54 min\n 73,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
