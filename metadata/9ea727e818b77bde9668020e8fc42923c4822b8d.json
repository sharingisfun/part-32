Aimed primarily at undergraduate and Masterâ€™s students, the text encourages the readers to reflect on economic processes, politics, immigrant lives and raises debates about inclusion, exclusion, and citizenship. The text critically highlights the global character of contemporary migration and the importance of historical context to current processes and emphasises the role of gender, race and national ideologies in shaping migration experiences.\r\n\r\nUsing over a decade of their own insight into teaching undergraduate migration courses in the US and the UK, and the knowledge and understanding of the subject they have acquired as migration researchers, the authors offer an accessible and student-friendly manner for readers to understand and explore the complex issue of migration. The book features numerous international case studies, a chapter dedicated to the perspective of the immigrants themselves, as well as key terms and further readings at the end of each chapter.\r\n\r\nBoth theoretically and empirically informed Global Migration examines the subject in a holistic and expansive way. It will equip students with an understanding of the complex issues of migration and serve as a guide for instructors in structuring their courses and in identifying important bodies of scholarly research on migration issues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea727e818b77bde9668020e8fc42923c4822b8d","amp;dn":"Global+Migration+-+Patterns%2C+Processes+and+Politics+%282016%29Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea727e818b77bde9668020e8fc42923c4822b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,167,39,232,24,183,123,222,150,104,2,14,143,196,41,35,196,130,43,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
