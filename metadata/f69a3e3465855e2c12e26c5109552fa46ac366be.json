Oftentimes, but by no means always, its lyrics reflect the harsher realities of a marginalized subculture's lifestyle.\nThus one finds themes such as crime, drink, drugs, poverty, prostitution and violence, but also a multitude of themes of relevance to people of any social stratum: death, eroticism, exile, exoticism, disease, love, marriage, matchmaking, the mother figure, war, work, and divers other everyday matters, both happy and sad.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe womb of rebetika was the jail and the hash den.\nIt was there that the early rebetes created their songs.\nThey sang in quiet, hoarse voices, unforced, one after the other, each singer adding a verse which often bore no relation to the previous verse, and a song often went on for hours.\nThere was no refrain, and the melody was simple and easy.\nOne rebetis accompanied the singer with a bouzouki or a baglamas (a smaller version of the bouzouki, very portable, easy to make in prison and easy to hide from the police), and perhaps another, moved by the music, would get up and dance.\nThe early rebetika songs, particularly the love songs, were based on Greek folk songs and the songs of the Greeks of Izmir and Istanbul.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nElias Petropoulos (Preface to: Rembetika, Songs from the Old Greek Underworld)\n\n(en.wikipedia.org)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
