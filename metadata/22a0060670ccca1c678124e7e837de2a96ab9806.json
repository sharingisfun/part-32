As a young child he learned to play the piano and bass guitar. \r\nAlthough Boals has never had any vocal lessons or training, as a teenager he gained experience as a vocalist in local groups. Boals is the founder and vocalist for the band Ring of Fire, and as of 2014, he is also the bassist for Dokken. And this guy has a long history in the Hard Rock/Metal genre.
