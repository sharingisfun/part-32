Mutants stalk the catacombs beneath the desolate surface, and hunt\n  amidst the poisoned skies above.\n\n  But rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro  are  locked\n  in a struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the  military\n  vaults of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe  humanity  from  the\n  face of the earth forever.\n\n  As Artyom, burdened by guilt but driven by hope, you hold the key  to  our\n  survival - the last light in our darkest hour...\n\n\n  Features:\n  =========\n  * A gripping, story-driven first person shooter, Metro: Last Light is the\n    hugely anticipated sequel to 2010\n  * Experience thrilling combat with an exotic arsenal of hand-made weaponry\n    against deadly foes\n  * Explore the post-apocalyptic world of the Moscow Metro, one of the most\n    immersive, atmospheric game worlds ever created\n  * Fight for every bullet and every last breath in a claustrophobic blend\n    of survival horror and FPS gameplay\n  * Next generation technology boasting stunning lighting and physics sets a\n    new graphical benchmark on both console and PC\n\n  DLC Included:\n  =============\n  * The &quot;Faction Pack&quot;: Includes three original single player missions, each \n    casting the player as a different specialist from the warring Factions. \n    Returning to some classic locations from Metro 2033, these missions feature \n    new weapons, the return of a truly terrifying mutant foe, and offer three \n    distinct gameplay challenges.\n\n  * The &quot;Tower Pack&quot;: Fight your way up through a heavily guarded tower stronghold.\n    Each level is increasingly difficult- Can you make it to the top?  Compare your \n    time and other stats against your friends with the added leaderboard functionality \n    and try again.  \n\n  * The &quot;Ranger Mode&quot;: Become completely immersed in the world of Metro. \n    Ranger Mode offers Metro veterans the ultimate challenge; the HUD is removed\n    for increased immersion, all resources including ammunition, filters and medkits\n    are more scarce, and combat becomes even deadlier as both you and your enemies \n    cause more damage.\n\n  * The &quot;RPK Machine Gun: A deadly Soviet era machine gun with a high rate of fire, \n    suitable for seasoned Rangers, is now available from all reputable gun traders in\n    the Moscow Metro...\n\n ***************************** \n**   **Install Notes:**      **\n ***************************** \n \n1.
