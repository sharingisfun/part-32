(not NYPD Blue) is a 30 minute crime drama that aired on ABC TV from 1967 through 1968.The show was set in the context of the New York City Police Dept.. Many scenes were filmed on location in NYC and many episodes were based on real NYPD cases. \n\nI bought online a DVD set that includes most of the episodes from both seasons. The videos look to be from various VHS sources as the quality varies greatly but most shows are decent quality. \n\nI used Handbrake to convert the DVD .VOB files to video MP4 files. I'm a novice at this stuff and handbrake seems easy to use and does a great job with compression with little loss of quality. I'm uploading the first three episodes from season one now and will upload more when I have time in the next few weeks.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443f67a5c7c4d6b7296ea34619dc2dd821f1c595","amp;dn":"N.Y.P.D.++TV+Series+%281967%29+Season+1+EPS+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443f67a5c7c4d6b7296ea34619dc2dd821f1c595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,63,103,165,199,196,214,183,41,110,163,70,25,220,45,216,33,241,197,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
