Actually older than she lets on in the opener Iâ€™m Young, the Bloomington artist can tell us that fear doesnâ€™t always leave. Itâ€™s something to fight back against for the rest of your life, but itâ€™s worth it for everything else, and Tobey has done a lot of everything else.\r\nIn the decade since her stunning solo debut, which combined intimate lyricism and roomy electric guitar arrangements, Tobey has played and toured in Bloomington acts like Mt. Gigantic and the scuzzy lo-fi duo Brendaâ€™s Friend. Sheâ€™s also gotten married and settled down, and sheâ€™s worked on her second solo album with her husband Jeff Grant and brother Matt Tobey. But Middlemaze is a reflection on the confusion that remains even in settling downâ€”how when you get past the beginning some things settle but the muddle of living doesnâ€™t always lessen in the ways you might expect it to when youâ€™re younger.\r\n\r\nTobeyâ€™s weapon is metaphor. With pictures from the rural outdoors and from mall security cameras, she makes the maze more endurable. â€œLoneliness like a kernel in your sneaker / pry it out,â€ she sings on â€œLonely Daughterâ€, her voice supple and calm, and suddenly loneliness is something tangible to dispose of. Meanwhile love is a lever with which to set someone free, and constant contact is a vice. Middlemaze has the vastness you could expect from someone whoâ€™s gathered experience in many worlds, including the worlds of punk and folk in near equal measure. Some of these songs have the energized country tinge of Jenny Lewisâ€™ songwriting, while others fall into line with Sibylle Baierâ€™s smooth, wrenching folk songs. And there are didactic moments that Tobey wouldnâ€™t have allowed herself ten years ago. Floating over the infectious sway of an organ on Work It Out, she runs over the rubric of compromise: â€œWork it out if we have to talk all night / say whatâ€™s wrong but make sure to say what is right.â€ But even these instructions feel more like a reminder to the self than advice from a wise parental figureâ€”there are things sheâ€™s learned, but it doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t bear repeating in private every so often. There are some creeping uncertainties that only widen after youth, triggered by the inevitability of death and the failing of relationships. Still, sometimes you have to make peace with the maze, take solace in just being there. So she sings on the penultimate song, â€œDeath to death and death to life / Iâ€™m here with you tonight.â€ We can walk through the thick of things with a comfort thatâ€™s lasting, at least for a little while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
