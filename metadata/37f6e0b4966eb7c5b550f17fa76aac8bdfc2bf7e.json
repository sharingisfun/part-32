Katten Og Vandalen\t 4:52\n\nFiolministeriet, or The Fiddle Ministry, is a string trio comprising Kirstine Sand (violin, vocals), Kirstine Elise Pedersen (cello, vocals), and Ditte Fromseier Mortensen (fiddle, viola, vocals). They draw much of their material from 18th century song collections and their home islands of Fuen and Bornholm. They have a powerful and rhythmic sound with the cello adding a solid underpinning not usually found in performances of traditional material. At times the arrangements sound quite classical in nature, like on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gottlob MinuetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; at other times, they sound traditional with the two violins playing in harmony. Ã¢â‚¬Å“VictoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a quiet piece that features Sand and plucked stings on the cello. Ã¢â‚¬Å“SeaquinsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a track that unites traditional tunes from Finland and Scotland, and the vocal tracks show all three as accomplished singers. A delightfully different and enlighten interpretation of traditional Danish folk music\n\ncd ripped by EAC \n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/02/05/fiolministeriet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/02/05/fiolministeriet/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f6e0b4966eb7c5b550f17fa76aac8bdfc2bf7e","amp;dn":"Fiolministeriet...Fiolministeriet%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f6e0b4966eb7c5b550f17fa76aac8bdfc2bf7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,246,224,180,150,110,183,197,181,80,241,127,167,106,172,139,223,194,191,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
