The concept and motivation of this film was to adapt a &quot;spectacular&quot; film into a radical critique of cultural hegemony and thus into tools of subversive revolutionary ideals.\n\nThe Narrative is based upon a conflict between the proletarian and bureaucrats within state capitalism. The proletarians enlist their dialectics and radical subjectivity to fight their oppressors whilst the bureaucrats defend themselves using a combination of co-optation and violence. The film is noted for its humorous approach to this serious subject matter.\n\nThe film also contains many praising references to revolutionaries who thought and fought for the realisation of a post-capitalist world, including Marx, Bakunin, and Wilhelm Reich, as well as scathing criticism towards the French Communist Party, trade unionism and Maoism. Also Subplots dealing with issues of gender equality, alienation, Paris Commune, May 1968, and the Situationist themselves are riddled throughout the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:991e4cee36eea7babe0dd823170921567e04db93","amp;dn":"Can+the+Dialectic+Break+Bricks+%28Vienet+1973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"991e4cee36eea7babe0dd823170921567e04db93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,30,76,238,54,238,167,186,190,13,216,35,23,9,33,86,126,4,219,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
