While most of the\nnew album was recorded in the studio, two tracks were in fact recorded live at\nthe club, and two more cut at a concert in London, England. The Jeff Healey\nBlues Band was formed as a ?house band? to accompany guests who sit in when\nHealey plays the club that carries his name, and to meet the ongoing\ninternational demand for the artist?s powerful and unusual guitar work.\n\nThe guitarist calls his group ?the best damned bar band in Canada,? and it\nconsists of Dave Murphy on keys (he also sings on two cuts), bassist Alec Fraser\n(who co-produced the record with Healey), Dan Noordermeer on guitar and Al\nWebster on drums.\n\n?Making this record is a chance to introduce the band to wider international\naudiences and give some great songs a new and fresh lease on life,? says Healey.\n\nChoosing the songs for Mess of Blues was easy, he says. ?For the most part\nthey?re tunes that get the best response when we play them live, either on tour\nor at home in the club.? Classics like ?The Weight,? ?Jambalaya,? ?How Blue Can\nYou Get,? and ?Shake Rattle and Roll? are all marked by Healey?s innovative and\nsparkling guitar work.\n\nAdds Healey: ?I?m really grateful to Ruf Records for giving me the opportunity\nto show people that my respect for the blues remains as strong as ever, as does\nthe commitment we all have to the people who come out to hear us when we play.?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cab57a08c889afd0157dcf46a159378eb0f3e513","amp;dn":"Jeff_Healey-Mess_Of_Blues-2008-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cab57a08c889afd0157dcf46a159378eb0f3e513","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,181,122,8,200,137,175,208,21,125,207,70,161,89,55,142,176,243,229,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
