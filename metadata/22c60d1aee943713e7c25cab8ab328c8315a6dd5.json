With these two funk veterans supplying the horns, Clinton had everything he could ask for in his already stellar group.\n\nThe opening song, &quot;P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up),&quot; harkened back to the opening title track from Parliament's previous album, Chocolate City, laying down a languid synth aura for a spoken-word intro. When &quot;P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)&quot; steps into second gear though, bringing in Bootsy's bass, Wesley's horn, Worrell's piano, and a chorus of vocalists, it's fairly evident just how large a step forward Mothership Connection is from the conventional R&amp;B roots of Chocolate City and Up for the Down Stroke.\n\nThe second song, &quot;Mothership Connection (Star Child),&quot; makes the differentiation glaringly evident, most noticeably when the song enters the cosmic, proto-hip-hop &quot;swing down sweet chariot&quot; bridge with its accompanying melody from beyond.\n\nThe funk doesn't stop there though, with the remaining five songs keeping the tempo laden with dense interweaving rhythms, peaking on &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker).&quot;\n\nIn the end, there's no questioning this album's impact, one that is still being felt via rap-induced aftershocks. In addition to its contemporary impact and continued longevity, the album was a massive success for Clinton and company upon its release in 1975, elevating the P-Funk collective to unparalleled heights in terms of audience. Some Parliament albums may be flawless, and others may be innovative, but this is the P-Funk zenith in more ways than one, perfect as well as perennial.\n\n\nTrack listing\n01 P.
