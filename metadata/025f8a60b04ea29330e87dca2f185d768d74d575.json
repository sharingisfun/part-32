Using special high-tech gloves to manipulate cubes in the environment, the player solves an array of conundrums - from physics-based challenges; to 3D jigsaws; to platform-based trials. \n\n\nFeature List \nSingle player campaign with an all new narrative \nChallenging and unusual puzzles \nNew time-trial mode with 10 levels \nBrand new original music score \nNew achievements and leaderboards \nOculus Rift support \n\n\nThe All New Story \nTo reboot the narrative, Toxic Games brought in industry veteran Rob Yescombe, writer on franchises including CRYSIS, ALIEN: ISOLATION, STAR WARS and PS4Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s upcoming RIME; winner of Best Thriller Screenplay at the Creative World Awards, and the screenwriting Award of Excellence at the Canada International Film Festival. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The DirectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cut is a single-location thrillerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Yescombe, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about figuring out what the Qube is, and why youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re inside it. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re told you are an astronaut inside some kind of alien structure hurtling towards Earth, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also about something deeper than that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nUnder the surface, there is a subtext about games themselves Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are conditioned to expect death and doom. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re resigned to it. At its heart, this story is about that state of mind and how it effects the way we view our experiences, in games and in life. The DirectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cut will feel either heroic or unnerving, depending on your own personal trust issues.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nMinimum: \nOS: Windows XP SP2 / Vista / 7 \nProcessor: 2.0+ GHz (Dual Core Recommended) \nMemory: 2 GB RAM \nGraphics: NVIDIA 8000 Series or higher (Shader Model 3 Compatible &amp; 128MB or more memory) \nDirectX: Version 9.0c \nHard Drive: 1100 MB available space \n\n1.&gt; Burn .iso to CD/DVD or mount using Daemon Tools. \n| 2.&gt; Install. \n| 3.&gt; Copy and overwrite .dll and .ini from /crack to game dir. \n| 4.&gt; Play Game.
