It begins with the shocking discovery of a body on the highway and her glimpse of a mysterious hooded figure watching from the side of the road. Then Ashley's investigation into the incident reveals a surprising connection to another crime scene miles away.\n\nIn the heart of the Everglades, Detective Jake Dilessio stares at the mutilated body of a woman--the killing identical to those carried out by a cult leader he put behind bars five years ago. Is this a copycat killing or is the wrong man doing time? The last thing Ashley and Jake want or need is the electric pull of desire as they are dragged deeper into a dangerous world of corruption and conspiracy. Now, with time running out and their lives on the line, they have everything to fight for...and everything to lose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15fb37694069ddca26de5f724569b83b5e668eae","amp;dn":"Heather+Graham+-+Picture+Me+Dead+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15fb37694069ddca26de5f724569b83b5e668eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,251,55,105,64,105,221,202,38,222,95,114,69,105,184,59,94,102,142,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
