The anthropomorphic cow, a reference to the Old Testament story of the golden calf that was worshiped as a graven idol, parodies Barney the dinosaur and elements of Disney. \r\nAccording to the Clerks II DVD commentary, Mooby was designed to be, &quot;As close to Mickey Mouse as possible without us getting sued.&quot; Also it may be based on the golden cow idol from Judaism which like mobby was gold, a cow, and stole faith from god.\r\n\r\nHit this link for more info about this adorable bovine. \nhttp://kevin-smith.wikia.com/wiki/Mooby_the_Golden_Calf\r\n\r\n*******REMEMBER*******\r\n******PLEASE SEED*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b6c10fdcbe5ac401978eef1328b77ff9709966","amp;dn":"Dogma+-+Score+from+the+Original+Motion+Picture.+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b6c10fdcbe5ac401978eef1328b77ff9709966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,182,193,15,220,190,90,196,1,151,142,239,19,40,183,127,249,112,153,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
