With a focus on fruit, Ripe is equal parts cookbook, primer on produce and gardening, and affectionate ode to the inspiration behind the book--SlaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forty-foot backyard garden in London.\nIntimate, delicate prose is interwoven with recipes in this lavishly photographed cookbook. Slater offers more than 300 delectable dishes--both sweet and savory--such as Apricot and Pistachio Crumble, Baked Rhubarb with Blueberries, and Crisp Pork Belly with Sweet Peach Salsa. With a personal, almost confessional approach to his appetites and gustatory experiences, Slater has crafted a masterful book that will gently guide you from the garden to the kitchen, and back again.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction\nApples\nApricots\nBlackberries\nBlack currants\nBlueberries\nCherries\nChestnuts\nDamsons\nElderflowers and elderberries\nFigs\nGooseberries\nGrapes\nHazelnuts\nPeaches and nectarines\nPears\nPlums\nQuinces\nRaspberries\nRed currants\nRhubarb\nStrawberries\nWalnuts\nA few other good things: medlars and sloes\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40fe1da71703aee23bddd4df2cd13dcd8242a3a","amp;dn":"Ripe+-+A+Cook+in+the+Orchard+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40fe1da71703aee23bddd4df2cd13dcd8242a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,15,225,218,113,112,58,238,35,189,221,77,242,205,19,220,216,36,42,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
