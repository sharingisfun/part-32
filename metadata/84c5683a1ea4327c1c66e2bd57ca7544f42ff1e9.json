They are like nothing Alex Cross and his new girlfriend, Detective Brianna Stone, have ever seen. With each murder, the case becomes increasingly complex. There's only one thing Alex knows: the killer adores an audience. \n\nAs victims are made into gruesome spectacles citywide, inducing a media hysteria, it becomes clear to Alex that the man he's after is a genius of terror--and he's after fame. The killer has the whole city by its strings--and he'll stop at nothing to become the most terrifying star that Washington D.C. has ever seen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c5683a1ea4327c1c66e2bd57ca7544f42ff1e9","amp;dn":"Double+Cross+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c5683a1ea4327c1c66e2bd57ca7544f42ff1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,197,104,58,30,164,50,124,28,102,226,189,87,202,117,68,244,47,241,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
