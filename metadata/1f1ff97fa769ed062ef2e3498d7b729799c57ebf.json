The book lays out the basics of the language, its syntax, and the interesting features that set it apart from JavaScript. It should satisfy anyone with an intermediate level of understanding of JavaScript who needs a conceptual and practical introduction to CoffeeScript.\n\nThe book is based around a practical project, leading you through the building of a simple HTML-based 2D game, and explaining the languageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s philosophy, syntax, and features step-by-step along the way. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to see results on-screen from the very beginning, starting with a simple JavaScript drawing function transformed into CoffeeScript. The gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s code is based on well- understood principles and prior art, using common, simple programming patterns that are easy to grasp while also demonstrating CoffeeScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expressiveness.\n\nThis is a fun and fast-paced book that rewards you for each completed step with interesting game features. You will finish the book with the sense of accomplishment that comes from building something fun, as well as having gained a solid understanding of CoffeeScript and an interest in exploring its more advanced features.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
