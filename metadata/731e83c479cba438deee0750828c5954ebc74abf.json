Sisters, Meg and Agatha, have their eyes on Ben and Howdy, but the boys aren't ready to settle down yet. They spend the winter in the high country corralling more than 100 stray cattle at $7 a head for Jim Ed. Most years, they blow their winter pay in one spring night at a Sedona bar, but this year, Ben and Howdy have a plan: to take an ornery roan that Ben has been unable to break and bet their bankroll that no cowboy at the Sedona rodeo can stay on the horse. What will they do if they win - marry the sisters or head for Tahiti?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731e83c479cba438deee0750828c5954ebc74abf","amp;dn":"The+Rounders+%281964%29+81+min.Henry+Fonda%2CGlenn+Ford.Comedy.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731e83c479cba438deee0750828c5954ebc74abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,30,131,196,121,203,164,56,222,238,7,80,130,140,89,84,235,199,74,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
