Archeological discoveries have\nincluded sexually explicit drawings on European cave walls\ndating from 30,000 B.C. to 10,000 B.C., and pornographic clay\nfigurines from the Neolithic period, 9,000 B.C. to 7,000 B.C.\nThe earliest cultures associated sexual acts with supernatural\nreligious forces. Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism and Shintoism\nall include erotic art as spiritually meaningful parts of their\nreligions. The Greeks and Romans included sexually explicit\nart in their culture and religious beliefs. Advances in technology\nwould be a boon to pornography and lead to its eventual\nblossoming. In 1727, German professor Johann Heinrich\nSchulze discovered that silver nitrate darkens when exposed to\nsunlight. This discovery would eventually lead to the production\nof motion pictures.\n\nThe first person to produce a permanent photographic\nimage was French aristocrat Joseph Nicephore Niepcein in\n1827. Following his death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre\nclaimed all credit and re-named the process the Ã¢â‚¬Å“daguerreotype.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe first known daguerreotype taken in the United\nStates is a self-portrait of photographer Robert Cornelius,\ndated 1839. By 1850, at least seventy daguerreotype studios\noperated in New York City, providing portraits to wealthy\npatrons.\n\nFrom 1884 to 1887 Eadweard Muybridge conducted\nexperi ments using a series of still cameras which photo graphed\nmoving subjects, thus creating the illusion of mo tion. His earliest\ntests included nude men and women doing things like\nwalking up stairs or swinging a baseball bat.\n\nThomas Edison perfected his Ã¢â‚¬Å“kinetoscope,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first\ndevice to record actual motion pictures, in 1889. Eastman\nKodak founder George Eastman soon introduced flexible film\nthat could be used in motion picture cameras. Edison began\nshooting his own short films by 1894.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb04cfb8afb203856d94d33af7d00b3e295a9720","amp;dn":"the+xxx+filmography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb04cfb8afb203856d94d33af7d00b3e295a9720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,4,207,184,175,178,3,133,109,148,211,58,247,208,11,62,41,90,151,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
