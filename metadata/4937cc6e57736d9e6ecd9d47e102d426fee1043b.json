Included are three CDs ripped to FLAC and tagged.\n\n&quot;My Sanctuary&quot; is the first Autamata album. It is the product of a fantastic collaboration with vocalists Carol Keogh and Cathy Davey and attracted much praise and good reviews.\n\n&quot;Tales from My Sanctuary&quot; is the EP associated with the above, and includes remixes of tracks from the Album and a track not found in &quot;My Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;.\n\n&quot;Colours of Sound&quot; is the second album, and has a very different sound. It lacks the vocal input of &quot;My Sanctuary&quot; but is still worth having.\n\nIf you like the music, buy McHugh's stuff and attend his events: small artists get a hard time in Ireland.\n\nSeedboxes and VPNs are cheap, but if you feel like helping out:\nbitcoin:1LG5NR5SxDSFsH7HoKwjfXLkwRxMws9Gog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4937cc6e57736d9e6ecd9d47e102d426fee1043b","amp;dn":"Autamata+-+My+Sanctuary%3B+Tales+from+My+Sanctuary%3B+Colours+of+Sou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4937cc6e57736d9e6ecd9d47e102d426fee1043b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,55,204,110,87,115,109,158,110,205,157,71,225,2,212,38,254,225,4,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
