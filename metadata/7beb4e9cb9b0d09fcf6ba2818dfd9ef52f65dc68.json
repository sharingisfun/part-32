Robb - Eve Dallas 32 - Salvation In Death-viny\n\n\nIn the year 2060, sophisticated investigative tools can help catch a killer. But there are some questions even the most advanced technologies cannot answer.\n\nRidley Pearson has praised J. D. RobbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suspense as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtautÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnerve-jangling.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Her latest thriller sets a new standard for suspense, as the priest at a Catholic funeral mass brings the chalice to his lips--and falls over dead.\n\nWhen Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas confirms that the consecrated wine contained potassium cyanide, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s determined to solve the murder of Father Miguel Flores, despite her discomfort with her surroundings. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the bodegas and pawnshops of East Harlem that bother her, though the neighborhood is a long way from the stone mansion she shares with her billionaire husband, Roarke. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all that holiness flying around at St. ChristobalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that makes her uneasy.\n\nA search of the victimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sparsely furnished room reveals little-- except for a carefully hidden religious medal with a mysterious inscription, and a couple of underlined Bible passages. The autopsy reveals more: faint scars of knife wounds, a removed tattoo--and evidence of plastic surgery, suggesting that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFather FloresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ may not have been the man his parishioners had thought. Now, as Eve pieces together clues that hint at gang connections and a deeply personal act of revenge, she believes sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s making progress on the case. Until a second murder--in front of an even larger crowd of worshippers--knocks the whole investigation sideways. And Eve is left to figure out who committed these unholy acts--and why","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7beb4e9cb9b0d09fcf6ba2818dfd9ef52f65dc68","amp;dn":"J.D.+Robb+-+Eve+Dallas+32+-+Salvation+In+Death-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7beb4e9cb9b0d09fcf6ba2818dfd9ef52f65dc68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,235,78,156,185,176,208,159,207,107,162,129,141,253,158,245,47,101,220,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
