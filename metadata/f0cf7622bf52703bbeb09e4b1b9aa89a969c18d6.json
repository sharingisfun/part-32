Written by guitarist Stone Gossard, \n&quot;Alive&quot; originated as an instrumental titled &quot;Dollar Short&quot; and was included \non a demo tape circulated in hopes of finding a singer for the group. Vocalist \nEddie Vedder obtained a copy of the tape and wrote lyrics that describe a \nfictionalized account of the time when he was told that the man he thought was \nhis father was not actually his biological parent. &quot;Alive&quot; charted at number \n16 in the UK (the single was available only through import in the US). \n\nThis music video was directed by Josh Taft, a childhood friend of Gossard, \nwho would later direct the music videos for &quot;Even Flow&quot; and &quot;Oceans&quot;. \nThe black-and-white video consists of a filmed live performance of the \nband filmed on August 3, 1991 during a Pearl Jam concert at RKCNDY in \nSeattle, Washington. Drummer Matt Chamberlain can be seen drumming in \nthe &quot;Alive&quot; video. Pearl Jam's future drummer Dave Abbruzzese was in \nthe audience when the video was shot. It was his first encounter with \nthe band as he had just arrived from Texas after being recommended for \nthe band by Chamberlain and only knew the songs from the &quot;Alive&quot; single. \n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive_(Pearl_Jam_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive_(Pearl_Jam_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:04:46\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
