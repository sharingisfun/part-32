Inspired by bands such as Bolt Thrower,\nHis Hero Is Gone, Dissection and Bathory, they decided to form a band that\nwas heavy and aggressive, but more importantly, original. Although\nunrefined, the demo laid the path for the albums soon to come.\n\nBand founders and mainstayers, Chris McMorrow and classically trained\nvocalist Jen McMorrow, and various line ups have released four EPs to date;\nincluding a split with Louisiana's Thou. They Forbidden Gates Beyond, the\nbands debut full length, originally self released in 2010, shows Black\nSeptember firing on all evil cylinders with a steady line up, and ready to\nunleash their madness upon the unsuspecting masses! The band has previously\nshared the stage with the likes of Unearthly Trance, Skeletonwitch,\nJavelina, Masakari, and Magrudergrind, amongst others, and will hit the road\naextensively this year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3b6a0e0e65b44dee686cfe91134603305b10f9","amp;dn":"Black_September-Forbidden_Gates_Beyond-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3b6a0e0e65b44dee686cfe91134603305b10f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,59,106,14,14,101,180,77,238,104,108,254,145,19,70,3,48,91,16,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
