Instead of the electrified funky style that other Chess bluesmen were going for in the early 70s, or which Waters used on his late 60s albums, this one is a more back to basics set ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with stripped down arrangements, and the kind of electric down homey feel that must have been big with the college kids. Pinetop Perkins plays piano on the set, and Carey Bell Harrington throws in a lot of harmonica. Titles include &quot;Electric Man&quot;, &quot;Trouble No More&quot;, &quot;Unk In Funk&quot;, &quot;Everything Gonna Be Alright&quot;, &quot;Waterboy Waterboy&quot;, and &quot;Rollin &amp; Tumblin&quot;\n\n\nTracklist\n\n01 - Rollin' And Tumblin' - 7:30\n02 - Just To Be With You - 3:57\n03 - Electric Man - 3:10\n04 - Trouble No More - 2:41\n05 - &quot;Unk&quot; In Funk - 3:24\n06 - Drive Me Blues Away - 2:50\n07 - Katie - 3:06\n08 - Waterboy Waterboy - 4:01\n09 - Everything Gonna Be Alright - 3:36","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9da6e556c3fe5ded2af985b059d8dff18933653","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+Unk+in+Funk%28blues%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9da6e556c3fe5ded2af985b059d8dff18933653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,218,110,85,108,63,229,222,210,175,152,91,5,157,141,255,24,147,54,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
