If nothing is listening on the port the test will fail no matter what. This program will open the port, listen for the connection and help ensure a proper and reliable test as to whether or not your port forwarding is working.\n\nDownload, install and run it. Put in the port you wish to test and hit begin, that's it!\n\nThe program now tests both TCP &amp; UDP ports.\n\nHome Page -\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d21ad4f631c0728b5a179d889009a85eef9a53b3","amp;dn":"Simple+Port+Tester+2.1.5+Silent+Installation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d21ad4f631c0728b5a179d889009a85eef9a53b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,26,212,246,49,192,114,139,90,23,157,136,144,9,168,94,239,154,83,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
