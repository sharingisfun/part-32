We focus equally on both style and\nquality, and if your reading our info, you already know that. We're\nnow in our fifteenth year, and we feel pretty confident about the\nwork we do. We have brought music to the masses, and in doing so\nhopefully made their lives that much better. For us, that is what\nits all about, and thats what keeps us going.\n\nWe purchase records and rip them so other people can hear the tracks\nand decide if they want to buy! We have paid for our records and\nthink you should also, if you do not subscribe to this, you are part\nof the problem.  So if you like a release please buy it. Don't be a\nskanky bitch about the price, just pay it! In doing so, you are\nsupporting what we all love so much. We sleep good at night cause we\nsupport the artists that produces electronic music, without whom we\nwouldn't have so much material to enjoy.  We know some releases are\nnearly impossible to find, so buy something else you like instead :D\n\nThe electronic music scene ain't like the pop and rock scene. Where\nfans pays 100Euro for a ticket to a concert! It's smaller and\nartists rely on units sold.  Since you probably downloaded this\nrelease and think you can have it for free -- you're wrong.  That\nmindset is killing the artists and the scene. Its simple, support\nthe people who support you, musically.\n\nWe at TechnoRulez are adamant about any of releases being posted in\npublic scene dupingchans and prechans! Please respect that, and\nremove our releases from the db's. We insist that the scene must be\nkept underground, and if the clueless lamers using such chans and\nwebsites cant comply with the terms, you will see alot less of us.\nThat doesn't mean we will slow down, but we will take action to keep\nour releases internal or a very limited spread.  It is simply\nunacceptable to post scene related info on *any* public source at\n*any* time.  Use your head.\n\nIn the words of a Luke Slater track, &quot;Lets get together&quot; and make\nthe scene a better place for all of us! keep the distance from\nthe n00bs, and unite more to keep the few bad apples from ruining\nour business!\n\nAs always, cheers!\n                                             /TechnoRulez 2015\n\np.s. We are currently looking for experienced Rippers!\n     You know where to find us!\n\n.........................::::: GREETINGS\n\n1REAL . AES . ALKi . AMOK . BEX . BOSS . CMC . CMG . dh . dL .
