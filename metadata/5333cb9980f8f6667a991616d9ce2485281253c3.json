Raw formats, however, changed all of that by allowing you to retrieve images before any in-camera processing has been performed. Photoshop's Adobe Camera Raw plug-in makes that process even easier by providing a standardized way of accessing and working with these uncompressed digital negatives in your favorite image-manipulation software. In the first volume devoted exclusively to the topic, best-selling author Bruce Fraser shows you how to take advantage of Adobe Camera Raw to set white balance, optimize contrast and saturation, handle noise, correct tint, and recover lost detail in images before converting them to another format. After learning about the raw formats themselves, you'll discover hands-on techniques for exposing and shooting for digital raw, using Bridge, Adobe's new standalone file browser, to preview images and automate tasks, and building a workflow around the digital raw process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5333cb9980f8f6667a991616d9ce2485281253c3","amp;dn":"Peachpit.Press.Real.World.Camera.Raw.with.Adobe.Photoshop.CS2.Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5333cb9980f8f6667a991616d9ce2485281253c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,51,203,153,128,248,246,102,122,153,22,22,217,206,36,133,40,18,83,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
