He loves telling tall tales and always brags about himself. According to him, he was picked up by a human couple who owns a diner while he was drifting around on an iceberg. \n\nThough he has lost all contact with his Canadian family, he has discovered a new home in serving the diners' clientele, thanks to the kind couple. His cafÃƒÂ© is an embodiment of his personality. The place is always packed with many regulars, animals and humans, who are drawn by his charismatic magnetism. \n\n\n\nRelease date       : April 12, 2012\n\n\nAudio language     : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language  : English\n\n\nStatus             : Currently Airing\n\n\nProducers          : Studio Pierrot\n\n\nGenres             : Comedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba12469b6318c457328ea404a0b0f015e1f557f","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Polar+Bear+Cafe+-+02+%5B1080p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba12469b6318c457328ea404a0b0f015e1f557f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,161,36,105,182,49,140,69,115,40,234,64,74,11,15,1,94,31,85,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
