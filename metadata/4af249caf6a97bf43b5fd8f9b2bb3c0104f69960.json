If anyone has this please link me to it.\n\nNote, in the ID3 tags for the pieces from Chuck, the 6-digit sequence of numbers refers to the time in the episode that the piece plays, e.g. for chuck_311 (271329) that piece plays in s03e11 at 27:13:29\n\nPrevious torrent became corrupted, to those of you using the old torrent file, use this file to check what you have completed so far","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af249caf6a97bf43b5fd8f9b2bb3c0104f69960","amp;dn":"Tim+Jones+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af249caf6a97bf43b5fd8f9b2bb3c0104f69960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,242,73,202,246,169,123,244,59,95,216,249,178,187,60,1,4,246,153,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
