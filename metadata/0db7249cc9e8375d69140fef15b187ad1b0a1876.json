With a PhD from MIT, Aldrin had not only spent eight years training for the mission, but also helped developed technology needed for the mission; upon returning home from his world tour as an &quot;unofficial space ambassador,&quot; however, he found the doors at NASA &quot;pretty much closed&quot;; the moon-landing program had given way to the shuttle project.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db7249cc9e8375d69140fef15b187ad1b0a1876","amp;dn":"Magnificent+Desolation%3A+The+Long+Journey+Home+from+the+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db7249cc9e8375d69140fef15b187ad1b0a1876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,183,36,156,201,232,55,93,105,20,15,239,21,177,135,173,27,10,24,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
