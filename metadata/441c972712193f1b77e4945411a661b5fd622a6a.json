Itâ€™s bullet-hell beat-em-up meets old-school RPG, in an arcadey party-game for up to 4 players.\r\n\r\nOne player is the hero, exploring a randomly generated dungeon full of traps and monsters - all controlled by the other players. If you slay the hero you take their place and itâ€™s your turn to crawl! Then it's a race to gain enough XP and loot to reach the final battle, where it's all on one as the other players collectively control the hulking final boss!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:441c972712193f1b77e4945411a661b5fd622a6a","amp;dn":"Crawl+v0.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"441c972712193f1b77e4945411a661b5fd622a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,28,151,39,18,25,63,27,119,228,148,84,17,166,97,181,253,98,42,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
