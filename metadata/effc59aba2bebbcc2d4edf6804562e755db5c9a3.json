I'm looking for another person to rip these. My DVR is shotty and I will not be able to cap these consistently. Just looking for someone to be backup in case my DVR fails.\n\n\nTONIGHT ON THE INDEPENDENTS (written by Matt Welch, taken from Reason)\n---------------------------\nTonight's live episode of The Independents (Fox Business Network, 9 p.m. ET, 6 p.m. PT, with re-airs three hours later) begins with the news that the White House fence jumper from the other week went WAAYYYY further into ye olde presidential mansion than was originally reported by the Secret Service, probably because people are stupid liars and should be fired. Party Panelists Julie Roginsky (Fox News contributor) and Katie Pavlich (co-host, Outnumbered) will dissect, and then assess whether President Barack Obama unfairly threw his own intelligence agencies under the bus when it comes to the Islamic State. Later, the duo will weigh in on California's asinine new &quot;Yes Means Yes&quot; anti-rape law.\n\nWas the beheading of a woman at a food plant in Oklahoma by a 30-year-old man who was busy trying to convert people to Islam an &quot;act of terrorism,&quot; or an example of &quot;workplace violence,&quot; or both/neither? The co-hosts will argue. How much money have school vouchers saved public school systems over the last two decades? It's a 10-figure number, says Robert C. Enlow of the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, which is releasing a brand new report on the topic. And speaking of educational de-control, you'll never guess which group of students and parents are being targeted by the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission as a response to the deadly rampage of Adam Lanza. I'll tell you all about it at the end of the program.\n\nOnline-only aftershow begins at foxbusiness.com/independents just after 10.

Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pass on video and AAC (faac) on audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : H:MediaBrianTelevisionThe IndependentsThe Independents 2014The.Independents.2014.09.29.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 352 MiB \nDuration : 42mn 18s \nOverall bit rate : 1 163 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3b73525c537b7708150b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 42mn 18s \nBit rate : 1 024 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 14.985 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.117 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1024 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 42mn 18s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 38.7 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:effc59aba2bebbcc2d4edf6804562e755db5c9a3","amp;dn":"The.Independents.2014.09.29.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"effc59aba2bebbcc2d4edf6804562e755db5c9a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,252,89,171,162,190,187,204,45,78,223,104,4,86,46,117,93,181,201,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
