She has released a few hits collections, including full-price titles on RCA and CBS and several budget titles on Castle, Crimson, and Camden, and despite her multitude of hit singles, none of performed particularly well on the album charts. This collection, titled From the Heart, just fell short of reaching the Top 30 in March 2007. It brought together the obvious hits from her CBS days and collaborations with producer Jim Steinman, mainly centering on the Faster Than the Speed of Night album with its title track and the giant number one single &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart,&quot; her hit duets with Shakin Stevens (&quot;Rockin Good Way&quot;), and Todd Rundgren (&quot;Loving You's a Dirty Job But Somebody's Gotta Do It&quot;); her other solo hits, from &quot;Holding out for a Hero&quot; from the Footloose soundtrack to the cover of the Air Supply hit &quot;Making Love out of Nothing at All.&quot; But this album also included her lesser heard, early RCA hits &quot;Lost in France,&quot; &quot;It's a Heartache,&quot; &quot;More Than a Lover,&quot; and even the title track from the dire film The World Is Full of Married Men (from the era of The Bitch and The Stud) although all of these were also included on the previous greatest hits from 2001. However, when an artist's hit singles are few and far between and there was no album success to speak of (apart from the Steinman number one), one would expect a best-of to feature some filler tracks, and this album did include the tracks &quot;If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man),&quot; the Beatles' &quot;In My Life&quot; sung with the City Of Prague Philharmonic, and the album closer &quot;Si Demain...&quot; (&quot;Total Eclipse&quot; alternately sung in French and English).\nAll Music Review by Sharon Mawer\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Total Eclipse Of The Heart\n[02] Lost In France\n[03] Faster Than The Speed Of Night\n[04] It's A Heartache\n[05] Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\n[06] Holding Out For A Hero\n[07] Loving You's A Dirty Job (But Somebody's Gotta Do It) - - - Bonnie Tyler &amp; Todd Rundgren\n[08] A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around And Fall In Love) - - - Shakin' Stevens &amp; Bonnie Tyler\n[09] In My Life\n[10] Making Love Out Of Nothing At All\n[11] (The World Is Full Of) Married Men\n[12] More Than A Lover\n[13] If You Were A Woman (And I Was A Man)\n[14] Streets Of Little Italy\n[15] You Won't See Me Cry\n[16] Louise\n[17] Si demain...
