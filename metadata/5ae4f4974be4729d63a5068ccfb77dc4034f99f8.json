This is still an experimental version, mostly meant as a functionality preview, put together to celebrate the 8th birthday of the WC CIC.\n\nTo install this package, simply unzip the contents into the prophecy directory. The following patches are included:\n\n- Video Skip Patch : corrects some video and comms issues on fast computers.\n- High-res Patch : allows using for high resolutions in the game (install.exe)\n- Multiplayer Patch: a test version of this patch is included, which allows for\n  2-4 player skirmishes. This is the most experimental part of the package:\n  everything is work in progress and nothing is remotely close to being optimized,\n  so it should be regarded as a pre-release.\n\nAfter unzipping the file, you can run prophecy.exe as usual to run the game or multiplayer.exe to run the game in the experimental multiplayer mode. Be sure to unblock port 5555, TCP/IP, from your firewall.\n\nNote that in order to enable the highres patch, you need to run install.exe . \n\nThis installer will need to find in the patch directory the files data.tre,gf.tre gf2.tre and gf3.tre, so copy them from the various CDs. Direct3D mode can handle pretty much any resolution supported by your hardware. \n_______________________________________________\n\nKudos to the creator -- Mario &quot;HCl&quot; Brito","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae4f4974be4729d63a5068ccfb77dc4034f99f8","amp;dn":"Wing+Commander+Prophecy+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae4f4974be4729d63a5068ccfb77dc4034f99f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,228,244,151,75,228,114,157,99,165,6,140,207,183,125,196,3,79,153,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
