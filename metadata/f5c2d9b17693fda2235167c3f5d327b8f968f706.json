It features the minor hits &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; and &quot;Beautiful World.&quot; The sound continued in the vein of the previous album Freedom of Choice, with synthesizers moved to the forefront and guitars more subdued. Some of the tracks feature drum machines for the first time on a Devo record. In addition, the lyrics are frequently dark and vitriolic.\n\n&quot;Beautiful World&quot; is considered by many fans and critics to be Devo's greatest music video, setting the tune to a series of connected images from film archives. The video features Booji Boy prominently, as he initially watches scenes of beautiful women, futuristic cars, and other happy elements, which by the end of the song have been replaced by images of race riots, the Ku Klux Klan, World War I, famine in Africa, car crashes and nuclear explosions, which puts a much darker slant on the song's lyrics. The video was slightly censored for broadcasts on the ABC-TV music show Countdown. A small segment of archive footage depicting a woman on fire was considered unsuitable for the show's early evening timeslotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½despite the fact that the 'flames' were animated, not realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and this censored version is still screened occasionally on the ABC's music video series Rage, including a mid-1990s episode hosted by Devo.\n\nMost of the songs on the album are very dark with the lyrics lacking the irony and wit that Devo was known for. The exception to this is &quot;Beautiful World.&quot; At first listen, the song seems very upbeat and happy, until the line &quot;It's not for me,&quot; which reveals the more cynical side of the song. This is made much clearer by the song's video.\n\nDevo is an American band formed in 1973 consisting of members from Kent and Akron, Ohio. The classic line-up of the band includes two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs (Mark, Bob, and Jim) and the Casales (Gerald and Bob). The band had a #14 Billboard chart hit in 1980 with the single &quot;Whip It&quot;, and has maintained a cult following throughout its existence. Their style over time has shifted between punk, art rock, post-punk, and New Wave. Their music and stage show mingle kitsch science fiction themes, deadpan surrealist humor, and mordantly satirical social commentary. Their often discordant pop songs feature unusual synthetic instrumentation and time signatures that have proven influential on subsequent popular music, particularly New Wave, industrial and alternative rock artists. Devo was also a pioneer of the music video, creating many memorable clips for the Laser Disc format, with &quot;Whip It&quot; getting heavy airplay in the early days of MTV.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Traditionalists&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Traditionalists&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EakgDAAdN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EakgDAAdN&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:33\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
