In simple terms, ReCycle lets you do with sampled loops what you can do with beats programmed from individual drum sounds - like alter the tempo, or replace sounds and process them individually. ReCycle turns concrete-rigid loops into musical modeling clay, allowing you, the loopist, to do pretty much what you desire.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.propellerheads.se/products/recycle/index.cfm?fuseaction=mainframe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.propellerheads.se/products/recycle/index.cfm?fuseaction=mainframe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNew in 2.1.2:\n\n-Now Leopard compatible.\n\nstill ppc, but works fine on intel.\n\n\nTo install:\n\n-Unzip\n-Install\n-Open No Cd dmg\n-Enter Serial No.\n-Register Later (never)\n\nSupport the developers, buy it if you can afford it!\n\nenjoy n seed forever!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:476a210ae054c8becbf8ba535c9e087a78c3e0fd","amp;dn":"Recycle+2.1.2+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"476a210ae054c8becbf8ba535c9e087a78c3e0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,106,33,10,224,84,200,190,203,248,186,83,92,158,8,122,120,195,224,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
