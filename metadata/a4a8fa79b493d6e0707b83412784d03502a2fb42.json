Film Critics 1944: Actress (Bankhead). \nREVIEW: When a German U-boat sinks a freighter during WWII, the eight survivors seek refuge in a tiny lifeboat. Tension peaks after the drifting passengers take in a stranded Nazi. Hitchcock saw a great challenge in having the entire story take place in a lifeboat and pulled it off with his usual flourish. In 1989, the film &amp;quot;Dead Calm&amp;quot; replicated the technique. From a story by John Steinbeck. Bankhead shines. \n\nDVD-RIP (DIVX-MP3)\nDUAL (English-Spanish) with Spanish Subs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a8fa79b493d6e0707b83412784d03502a2fb42","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock-Lifeboat-1944%5BDVDRIP%5D%5BSpa-Eng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a8fa79b493d6e0707b83412784d03502a2fb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,168,250,121,180,147,214,224,112,123,131,65,39,132,208,53,2,162,251,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
