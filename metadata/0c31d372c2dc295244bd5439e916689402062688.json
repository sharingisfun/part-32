Mr. Nakatani (currently\r\nliving in the Poconos, PA) is an amazing percussionist who has his own approach\r\nand tours around the world as much as is possible playing with an unlikely cast\r\nof improvisers: Jack Wright, Michel Doneda, Eugene Chadbourne, Mary Halvorson\r\nto Frank Gratkowski. Guitarist extraordinare, Shane Perlowin (Ashville, NC), is\r\na founding member of the progressive/math rock band Ahleuchatistas, who have\r\nsome half dozen releases on the Cuneiform &amp; Tzadik labels. I'm not sure when or\r\nhow they met but since Tatsuya is always on the road, I can imagine how they\r\nended up on the same bill. If you've ever checked out Mr. Nakatani live, you\r\nknow that he has a unique way of playing drums and cymbals. Mr. Perlowin sounds\r\nas if he is playing acoustic guitar on some of this disc. And since this is a\r\nstudio recording the balance and sound are most superb and often sublime. The\r\nfirst piece is really quiet and quite lovely with a mysterious aura of suspense\r\nsurrounding it. Mr. Perlowin sounds more like a stripped down version of John\r\nFahey here, playing forlorn, cascading lines while Nakatani rubs his drums with\r\ngongs or cymbals. Shane switches to his electric guitar about halfway through\r\nbut still plays with a laid-back, spacious and spooky vibe, a sort of raga-rock\r\nlike sound. Reminding me of that Bay Area psych from the late sixties (like the\r\nAirplane or Country Joe &amp; the Fish). The focal point of most of this music is\r\nPerlowin's (mostly) acoustic guitar which sounds immensely haunting and does a\r\nfine job of taking us along with him on a journey through distant\r\nlands. Tatsuya embellishes everything the Shane does with subtle shades, rarely\r\nerupting into his more intense percussive detours. An excellent duo release\r\nthat sounds as if they have been playing together for many years.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Dave Wayne \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/anatomy-of-a-moment-tatsuya-nakatani-and-shane-perlowin-new-atlantis-records-review-by-dave-wayne.php\r\n\r\nBy Clifford Allen\r\n\r\nBy Jonathan Hielkema \nhttp://www.calvin.edu/chimes/2014/02/07/anatomy-of-a-moment-highlights-improvised-art/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c31d372c2dc295244bd5439e916689402062688","amp;dn":"Tatsuya+Nakatani+and+Shane+Perlowin+-+Anatomy+of+a+Moment+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c31d372c2dc295244bd5439e916689402062688","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,49,211,114,194,220,41,82,68,189,84,57,233,22,104,148,2,6,38,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
