Users can also attach pictures and photos to objects and change their shape, break them apart, or melt them.\n\nUse your imagination to create your own unique world!&quot;\n\nI cannot find downloads for this ANYWHERE, let alone any torrents of it, so here you guys go.  Although the program is pretty simple, I will say you will play with it for hours making things (I sure as hell have!)  :)\n\nTo see what this software can do, simply search OE Cake on Youtube.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfdfa7e26d6808f72d0f6cad46854d8a43c950b0","amp;dn":"OE-Cake+v1.1+%282D+Physics+Simulator%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfdfa7e26d6808f72d0f6cad46854d8a43c950b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,223,167,226,109,104,8,247,45,15,108,173,70,133,77,138,67,201,80,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
