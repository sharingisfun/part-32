Welcome to the last, bloody stand of The Boys! Billy Butcher, Wee Hughie, Mother's Milk, The Frenchman, and The FEMALE have driven the superhumans of the world -- and the shadowy agencies backing them -- to the very brink. Now, it's all-out war! But will all The Boys come out unscathed... and will those that live through the endgame survive one another when all is said and done? Featuring the creative talents of Garth Ennis, Darick Robertson, Russ Braun, and John McCrea, this collection is the must-read conclusion to the explosive BOYS epic!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa783c1dbbf4aae21c1e72db0f33e6827ed652ff","amp;dn":"The+Boys+Omnibus+vol+03+%282012%29+%28F%29+%28New+Rip%29+%28digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa783c1dbbf4aae21c1e72db0f33e6827ed652ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,120,60,29,187,244,170,226,28,30,114,219,15,51,230,130,126,214,82,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
