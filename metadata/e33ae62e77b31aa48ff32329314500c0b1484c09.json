Tom started baking with his father and \n       grandfather and at 16 began his formal apprenticeship. Fresh out \n       of college, he won Young Baker of the Year and now, at 32, Tom \n       continues to win awards for the family firm, Hobbs House Bakery.\n       \n       Tom is passionate about handmade bread and critical of what he \n       describes as the 'plastic-wrapped pap' of the mass-produced bread \n       market. However, given that sales of handmade bread only account \n       for 2 per cent of the market, Tom has his work cut out if he is to \n       convert more people to the joys of handmade bread.\n       \n       Tom's quest to make the perfect loaf takes him to Cornwall to meet \n       archaeologist Jacquie Wood, to learn how our ancestors might have \n       baked bread. At the medieval water mill at Stanway House in \n       Gloucestershire he meets Professor Brian Reuben, a leading \n       authority on the history of bread, and he visits Brackman's Jewish \n       bakery in Salford run by third generation baker, Andrew Adelman. \n       Here, Tom learns how to make the specialist Jewish bread challah \n       and meets the rabbi who, on his daily inspection of the baking \n       methods and ingredients, ensures that they conform to Jewish \n       religious law.\n       \n       Tom's journey helps him to come up with what he hopes will be a \n       competition-winning loaf for the National Organic Food Awards - a \n       huge two-kilo, white, spelt, sourdough loaf made using his \n       family's 40-year-old sourdough, organic spelt from Somerset, \n       Cornish sea salt and Cotswold water from a local spring. Tom names \n       it 'The Shepherd's Loaf'. But while it's his perfect loaf, will \n       the judges agree?\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n           * also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n           * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs\n           * winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n           * dont forget to tag your work\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e58716c7d7b5e766b6d76307f77&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33ae62e77b31aa48ff32329314500c0b1484c09","amp;dn":"In.Search.Of.The.Perfect.Loaf.2010.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33ae62e77b31aa48ff32329314500c0b1484c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,58,230,46,119,179,26,164,143,243,35,41,49,69,0,192,177,72,76,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
