Issue #1 was published by Wonder Color in 1987, #2 by Pied Piper Comics in 1988, then onto Innovation in 1990, which reprinted the first two issues (with new material added) in a three-issue series, before finishing the story in 1991 in the 'Power Factor Special'. Kevin Juaire was the creator and the synopsis of the series is as follows:\n\nIn a world where all superheros have either been destroyed or forced into hiding by the Criminal Underworld a few remaining heroes don the costumes of many different heroes to rally against the Underworld.\n\nThis torrent contains the first issue from Wonder Comics and all of the Innovation issues (which is all you really need for the whole story). A legion of praises for the creators and the scanners! Get it, seed it!
