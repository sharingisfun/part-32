One of best Documentaries ever produced. A must have for all Christians.\n\nFor decades, a phenomenon has been recurring in the Muslim world. Men and women - without any knowledge of the Gospel and without any contact with Christians - have been profoundly affected after experiencing dreams and visions of Jesus Christ. &quot;More Than Dreams&quot; is a 187-minute, full-color, 'docu-drama' that tells the story of a genuine phenomena taking place throughout the Muslim communities.\n\nThere are five such stories/episodes of former Muslims who now follow Jesus as their Savior, recreated in docu-drama format. Each story includes a segment, explaining what it means to follow Christ. Produced in their original languages with English subtitles.\n\nEpisode 2 deals with Dini, an Indonesian teenager who became a Christian on a night that Muslims individualize their prayers to Allah. She immediately became filled with peace, even as persecution began.\n\nRuntime: 43 mins\nLanguage: Indonesian\nSubtitles: English \nYear: 2007\nMy Rating: 10/10\nQuality: 10/10 \n\n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films/documentaries in business.
