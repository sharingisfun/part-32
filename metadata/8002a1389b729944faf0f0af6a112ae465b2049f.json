With Asia's economy and population booming, what changes will Julian detect from previous visits? Julian's journey begins rather inauspiciously in Hong Kong, where he foolishly volunteers to take one of Bruce Lee's famed one-inch punches at a martial arts school. After a sudden necessity to visit the bathroom shortly thereafter, it's at least a lesson learned. In Thailand, Julian tags along with investigative journalists and is recruited as an undercover spy to film an exposÃ© on illegal gambling. Once again Julian finds he might have got himself in a little deeper than he would have liked, another lesson learned. Typically, whenever Julian is involved, there appears to be a pattern forming. Subsequent visits to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and China also offer lots more education for Julian. Let's just say Julian is a great student of world travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6)  Indonesia \r\nIndonesia, a Southeast Asian nation made up of thousands of volcanic islands, is home to hundreds of ethnic groups speaking many different languages. It's is known for its beaches, volcanoes and jungles sheltering elephants, tigers and Komodo dragons. On the island of Java lies Indonesia's vibrant, sprawling capital, Jakarta, and the city of Yogyakarta, known for gamelan music and traditional puppetry. We were travelling Indonesia this summer discovering its almost infinite number of islands. Starting in Jakarta we made our way through Java, reaching Bali and the Gilis and setting off by boat from Lombok to Flores and the Komodo National Park\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3152 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 7\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.01 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv.nu/program/asian-times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8002a1389b729944faf0f0af6a112ae465b2049f","amp;dn":"Asian+Times+Series+1+6of7+Indonesia+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8002a1389b729944faf0f0af6a112ae465b2049f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,2,161,56,155,114,153,68,250,240,240,175,106,17,42,228,101,178,4,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
