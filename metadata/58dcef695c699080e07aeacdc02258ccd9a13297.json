The album reinvents eleven\nof their most underappreciated songs, and also includes the track &quot;Ponytail\nGirl,&quot; the Color Theory original that was mistakenly credited as a Depeche\nMode track from their Exciter album. To this day, several European web\nsites sell alternate versions of Exciter with &quot;Ponytail Girl&quot;included as a\nso-called &quot;bonus track.&quot; Depeche-Mode.com wrote of the tribute CD, &quot;We give\nit the thumbs up and warmly recommend that all Mode fans pick this one up.&quot;\n\nIf you like this release, you will like Color Theory's new album &quot;The\nThought Chapter&quot; even more!
