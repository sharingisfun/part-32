So just be aware, \nwhat i think is ok quality might not be your opinion. \nI do comment if the film is seriously degraded in one way or the other.\nAnd if you have a better copy, i sure would love to hear from you.\nthanks &amp; enjoy.\n\nRedo of my previous torrent, to reduce file size and new format, mkv.\nPlease Note: video clarity not so good, it is in the source. The original torrent\nis still up, avi file, twice the size of this torrent.
