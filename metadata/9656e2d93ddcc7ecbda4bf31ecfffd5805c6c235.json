That's the question at the heart of this volume in the Great Debates in Philosophy series, with Alvin Plantinga and Michael Tooley each addressing this fundamental question with distinctive arguments from opposing perspectives.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n&quot;I would recommend the book to professional philosophers of religion and philosophy graduate students for these significant contributions.&quot; (Journal of Religion, 1 October 2010)\n&quot;The book's style is very different from other philosophy of religion texts, because it presents the issues within the context of a lively debate, capturing the excitement of philosophical argumentation and epitomizing how philosophy should be practiced.&quot; (American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly, Summer 2010)&quot;Alvin Plantinga and Michael Tooley here debate the question whether God's existence is knownÃ¢â‚¬â€or, at least, justifiably believed. As expected from two such distinguished philosophers, their discussion has the originality and intellectual weight to repay careful consideration, as much by philosophers of mind and epistemologists as by philosophers of religion.&quot; (Mind, October 2009)\n\n&quot;The book illuminates some important issues in philosophical theology. Recommended.&quot; (CHOICE, October 2008)\n\n&quot;I found this book strangely compelling Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ .Plantinga uses an ingenious new version of the Design Argument to demonstrate 'the epistemic probability' that God exists; Tooley argues that 'the fact of evil' on our world makes the existence of a benevolent God 'very unlikely.'&quot; (Church Times, January 2009)\n\n&quot;The present volume, by two heavyweight analytical philosophers, is rather different from the usual pattern.&quot; (The Tablet)\n\n&quot;A very fine book, presenting arguments for and against theism and naturalism by two very distinguished philosophers. I strongly recommend it for graduate level courses.&quot; (Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews)\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Knowledge of God is a work of major significance. There is no other debate-style book in the philosophy of religion that packs the intellectual punches thrown by heavy-weights Plantinga and Tooley. Excellent.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Ã¢â‚¬â€œThomas Senor, University of Arkansasz\n&quot;A rigorous yet accessible debate on central issues in the philosophy of religion by two leading contributors to the field. When Plantinga and Tooley turn to discuss each other's views, they shed light not only on these topics but on a whole range of further issues, including minds and materialism, propositional content, evolutionary explanation, and probabilistic reasoning. A first-rate exchange, full of philosophical insight.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œEdward Wierenga, University of Rochester\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nIs belief in God justified? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the fundamental question at the heart of this volume of the Great Debates in Philosophyseries. Alvin Plantinga and Michael Tooley each tackle the matter with distinctive arguments fromopposing perspectives. The book opens with an explanation of the philosophersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ viewpoints, followed by a lively and engaging conversation in which each directly responds to the otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arguments.\nAbout the Author\nAlvin Plantinga is John A.
