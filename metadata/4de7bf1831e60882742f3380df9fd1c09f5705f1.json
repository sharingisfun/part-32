For many people the camera has replaced the sketchbook, but the author argues that freehand drawing as a means of analysing and understanding buildings develops visual sensitivity and awareness of design. There is a balance of drawing techniques explained as well as guidance provided on how drawing interfaces with photography, aCAD and model making in the genesis of design projects. This second edition incorporates examples from architectural practice, including those of architects Lord Foster, Sir Terry Farrell, Edward Cullinan, Richard Murphy and Sir Nicholas Grimshaw.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de7bf1831e60882742f3380df9fd1c09f5705f1","amp;dn":"Understanding+Architecture+Through+Drawing+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de7bf1831e60882742f3380df9fd1c09f5705f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,231,191,24,49,230,8,130,116,47,51,128,223,159,209,192,159,87,5,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
