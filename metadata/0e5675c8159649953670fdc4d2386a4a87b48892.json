Scot Aaron's Shamanism and his sounds stem from an academic background and worship experiences in the world religions, fused with decades of training as an artist (with over a 1000 paintings and poems, 3 books in print, and more recently some short films and music videos). Note: Scot Aaron spent years traveling to sacred places throughout Earth. \n\nGovinda Schlegel is a Shivite Hindu, spending years in Banaras/Varanasi studying the Sitar and North Indian Classical Music.\n\n  Peace :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5675c8159649953670fdc4d2386a4a87b48892","amp;dn":"Shaman+Strings+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Sitar%2C+Meditation%2C+Mystic+Spiritual+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5675c8159649953670fdc4d2386a4a87b48892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,86,117,200,21,150,73,149,54,112,253,196,210,56,106,74,135,180,136,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
