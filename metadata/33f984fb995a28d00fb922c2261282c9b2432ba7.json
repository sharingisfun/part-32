Potter's Field\n 3. Anthem for the Underdog\n 4. Beneath The Scars\n\nEP\n 5. The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday\n\nSoundtrack appearance*\n 6. Daredevil: The Album - Let Go\n\n\nSingle\n7. We Are One (WWE Mix)**\n\n*Note 1: I have included 2 album arts here, I believe the 1 I assigned is the \n          correct 1, but you can pick the 1 you like.\n\n**Note 2: As stated, the REAL version of this single, theres a lot of torrents that \n          are not exactly fake, but inaccurate, and just have the original from Easy \n          Day as the WWE Mix. The WWE Mix has an entirely different guitar mix \n          towards the middle of the song. Compare the two, and you'll see the \n          difference.\t\n\n\nSeed and enjoy!\n\nHMD3\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33f984fb995a28d00fb922c2261282c9b2432ba7","amp;dn":"12+Stones+Discography+thru+2012+Beneath+The+Scars+%5BHMD3%5D%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33f984fb995a28d00fb922c2261282c9b2432ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,249,132,251,153,90,40,208,15,185,34,194,38,18,130,201,178,67,43,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
