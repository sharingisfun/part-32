For those die-hard fans who probably already had the complete set of albums, and were paying out ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½51:39 for them all again, the temptation of an extra L.P. of unreleased Beatles gems was an opportunity not to miss !\nBUT (why are there always but's with E.M.I. ??) ... firstly, there wasn't anything really unique on the album as you will see from the track detail below, and worse of all, just 10 months later, out it appeared as a release in it's own right. \nThe main feature of the unreleased tracks was supposed to be that here they would be in stereo for the first time ... but, even that was not the case. In fact of the 17 tracks, just FOUR were stereo !\nSo what we had here were a collection of b-sides, E.P. tracks, and a german single ... WOW !\nThe tracklisting below gives the differences (or intended differences !). \n\nAnd to be fair to E.M.I. on the second point, many record dealers in England were separating the set, and selling the &quot;Rarities&quot; album at any price they could get (even triple it`s true value) ... and as it didnt have an R.R.P. who could blame them.\nIn fact, I was one of those very dealers !!\nSo, to thwart the inscrupulous dealers E.M.I. gave it an official release. \n\nThe sleeve design was as minimal as we had now come to expect, with no sleeve notes (although, the later &quot;official&quot; release did add some), and some tracks marked as stereo were not ... and that was NOT corrected with the second version. \n\n \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Beatles - Rarities [UK] \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Beatles\nAlbum................: Rarities [UK] \nGenre................: Britpop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1978\nRipper...............: By Pbtone.com &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.1.0 20030126\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 99 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: www.music.pbtone.com\n\nRipped by............: mrsjs on 12/18/2008\nPosted by............: mrsjs on 12/18/2008\n\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, SFV, M3U, MD5, FFP\nCovers...............: Front, Rear\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
