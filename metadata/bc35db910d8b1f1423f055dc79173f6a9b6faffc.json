The power ballad was released in late 1989 and written by bandmates Rachel Bolan and Dave &quot;the Snake&quot; Sabo. It reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #23 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks in early 1990.\n\nIn an interview, vocalist Sebastian Bach commented &quot;'I Remember You' was the #1 prom song in the United States of America in the year 1990... You talk about making memories! Literally the whole country of America did their prom dance to 'I Remember You' one year, and that's a real heavy memory to beat.&quot; \n\nIn 2003, Skid Row, this time featuring new lead singer Johnny Solinger, recorded a second version of the song entitled &quot;I Remember You Two.&quot; The song appears in the album Thickskin.\n\n&quot;I Remember You&quot; appeared on the ABC series October Road, FOX's Reunion, and Comedy Central's South Park.\n\nIn 2000, the punk rock band The Ataris covered the song for the compilation album Punk Goes Metal. The cover featured a few sampled bars of the original Skid Row version at the beginning and Sebastian Bach's high note at the climax of the song.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc35db910d8b1f1423f055dc79173f6a9b6faffc","amp;dn":"Skid+Row+-+I+Remember+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc35db910d8b1f1423f055dc79173f6a9b6faffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,53,219,145,13,139,31,20,35,240,85,220,121,23,63,106,155,111,175,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
