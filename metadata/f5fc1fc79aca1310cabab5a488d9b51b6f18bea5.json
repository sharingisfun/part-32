Sorry about mis-spellings and missing info but I did the best I could.\n\nI hope you enjoy.  I know the Frank and Chris show was a special time for a lot of people in the history of the Revelations Radio Network.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fc1fc79aca1310cabab5a488d9b51b6f18bea5","amp;dn":"Frank+And+Chris+Show+Archive+With+Show+Notes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fc1fc79aca1310cabab5a488d9b51b6f18bea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,252,31,199,154,202,19,16,202,186,181,164,136,217,181,27,111,24,190,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
