Listen to Flashbulb of Orgasm and its opening charging assault and you'll get the idea of what's to expect in the next 69 minutes. Listening to this brought to my mind, Mr. Bungle, Frank Zappa, Miriodor and Invincible Czars, to give you a rough estimate of what to expect...&quot;\n-- Assaf Vestin, aka Avestin / www.progarchives.com --\n\n&quot;...miRthkon's Vehicle is a compelling, entertaining and rewarding slice of idiosyncratic avant-prog. It's bizarre, uncompromising, funny, and rather brilliant.&quot;\n-- The Hemulen / www.progarchives.com --\n\n&quot;...With Vehicle, miRthkon has provided us with a veritable melting pot of genres, styles, and a very healthy dose of humor...\nthese guys do the whole &quot;genre-bending&quot; thing better than any other band I've listened to who are supposed masters of it. The music is generally on the heavy side, with a lot of jazz sensibilities thrown in. A big chunk of the album is instrumental, with only a few of the songs having vocals...\nIt's a fun, non-stop ride from beginning to end.&quot;\n-- SaltyJon / www.progarchives.com --\n\n\nmore infos and reviews at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=4665&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=4665&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/vehicle-r1612480/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/vehicle-r1612480/review&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4251290a862aff818d17dc30b07ac435870ad36","amp;dn":"miRthkon+-+2009+-+Vehicle+%28+U.S.+Am.+R.I.O.+%2F+Avant+Prog+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4251290a862aff818d17dc30b07ac435870ad36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,37,18,144,168,98,175,248,24,209,125,195,11,7,172,67,88,112,173,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
