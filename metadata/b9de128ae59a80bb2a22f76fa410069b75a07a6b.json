As a boy, having acquired familiarity with France and its language from his French-born grandmother (it is not certain whether Makine had a French grandmother; in later interviews he claimed to have learned French from a friend), he wrote poems in both French and his native Russian.\n\nIn 1987, he went to France as a member of a teacher's exchange program and decided to stay. He was granted political asylum and was determined to make a living as a writer in French. However, Makine had to present his first manuscripts as translations from Russian to overcome publishers' skepticism that a newly arrived exile could write so fluently in a second language. After disappointing reactions to his first two novels, it took eight months to find a publisher for his fourth, Dreams of My Russian Summers. Finally published in 1995 in France, the novel became the first in history to win both the Prix Goncourt and the Prix MÃƒÂ©dicis plus the Goncourt des LycÃƒÂ©ens.\n\nIn 2001 Makine began secretively publishing as &quot;Gabriel Osmonde&quot;, a total of four novels over ten years, the last appearing in 2011. It was a French literary mystery and many speculated about who Osmonde might be. Finally in 2011 a scholar noticed Osmonde's book 20,000 femmes dans la vie dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un homme had been inspired by Makine's Dreams of My Russian Summers and Makine confirmed that he was the author. Explaining why he used a pseudonym he said, &quot;I wanted to create someone who lived far from the hurly-burly of the world&quot;.\n\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB and FB2 format:\n\n* A Hero's Daughter, 1996\n\n* Music of a Life, 2004\n\n* Crime of Olga Arbyelina, 2000\n\n* Dreams of My Russian Summers, 1997\n\n* Human Love, 2008\n\n* Once Upon the River Love, 1996\n\n* Requiem for a Lost Empire, 2001\n\n* The Earth and Sky of Jacques Dorme, 2005\n\n* The Life of an Unknown Man, 2010\n\n* The Woman Who Waited, 2006\n\n\n\nRead the article, interviews, and SEED the torrent and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre%C3%AF_Makine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre%C3%AF_Makine&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9986647/Andrei-Makine-interview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9986647/Andrei-Makine-interview.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.italoeuropeo.com/interviews/1352-interviewing-andrei-makine-russian-born-french-author&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.italoeuropeo.com/interviews/1352-interviewing-andrei-makine-russian-born-french-author&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/interview-andrei-makine--through-the-iron-curtain-to-paris-1077329.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/interview-andrei-makine--through-the-iron-curtain-to-paris-1077329.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9de128ae59a80bb2a22f76fa410069b75a07a6b","amp;dn":"Andrei+Makine+-+Russian-French+Author+%2810+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9de128ae59a80bb2a22f76fa410069b75a07a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,222,18,138,229,154,128,187,42,34,247,111,164,16,6,155,117,160,122,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
