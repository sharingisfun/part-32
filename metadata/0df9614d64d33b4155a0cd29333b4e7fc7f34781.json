In it youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a few high-profile peeps heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s managed to connect with Ã¢â‚¬â€œ folks like Boots Riley who you may know from The Coup, Zumbi from Zion-I and Myron Glasper whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sung background vocals for everyone from MC Lyte to Blackalicious to Lyrics Born. Among the names you may know, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find incredibly talented MCs and vocalists who you may not know. Once again, blocSonic brings you real hip-hop with a touch of R&amp;BÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ this fresh sound comes to you straight out of Northern California.\n\nI want to say thanks to ETHX for approaching blocSonic in the first place and his guests for being part of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boom To BloomÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Welcome to the blocSonic fam!\n\nWe hope you enjoy this release and it gets heavy rotation in all your portable devices, CD players and computers. If you dig it, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to spread the wordÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share it with anyone and everyone you can.\n\nCheck out blocSonic for more quality releases!\n\nPeace\n\nMike Gregoire\n\nFounder/Curator blocSonic.com\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection:\n\nArtist/Composer: ETHX\nDate: 2009-01-26\nKeywords: hip-hop; indepenent; r&amp;b\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005.pdf.zip \tZIP \t7.9 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t57.9 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t85.7 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t872.2 KB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t152.9 KB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t6.1 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0005_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t223.1 MB\nBSOG0005_vbr.m3u \tVBR M3U \tStream\nBSOG0005_vbr_mp3.zip \tVBR ZIP \t41.7 MB\nAudio Files \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3 \tVBR MP3\n01 - ETHX - 8 Days (Featuring Erin Nicole) \t2.3 MB\n\t4.7 MB\n\t4.3 MB\n02 - ETHX - Wondering Why (Featuring Nate Mezmer and Janice Bailon) \t2.5 MB\n\t4.9 MB\n\t4.1 MB\n03 - ETHX - The Opening (Featuring Sedrick the MC) \t1.6 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n04 - ETHX - Sonic Boom \t1.0 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n05 - ETHX - Rhymes For A Reason (Featuring Zumbi, Nate Mezmer and Alyra Rose) \t3.0 MB\n\t6.0 MB\n\t5.0 MB\n06 - ETHX - Rock (Featuring Distant Relatives) \t2.6 MB\n\t5.1 MB\n\t4.1 MB\n07 - ETHX - Boomtown (Featuring Wordsmith) \t2.9 MB\n\t5.5 MB\n\t4.8 MB\n08 - ETHX - Dirty Dozen (One For The Money) (Featuring Nate Mezmer) \t2.9 MB\n\t5.7 MB\n\t4.8 MB\n09 - ETHX - Evaporation Of A Soul \t1.5 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n\t2.6 MB\n10 - ETHX - Get Involved (Featuring Nate Mezmer, Boots Riley and Erin Nicole) \t2.2 MB\n\t4.6 MB\n\t4.0 MB\n11 - ETHX - We Gon' Ride (Featuring Nate Mezmer and Myron Glasper) \t2.3 MB\n\t5.1 MB\n\t3.9 MB\nImage Files \tJPEG \tJPEG Thumb\nBSOG0005.jpg \t133.1 KB\n\t6.7 KB\nInformation \tFormat\tSize\nBSOG0005_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file]\nBSOG0005_meta.xml \tMetadata \t2.3 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0df9614d64d33b4155a0cd29333b4e7fc7f34781","amp;dn":"%5BBSOG0005%5D+ETHX+-+Boom+to+Bloom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0df9614d64d33b4155a0cd29333b4e7fc7f34781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,249,97,77,100,211,59,65,85,160,205,41,51,59,78,127,199,243,71,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
