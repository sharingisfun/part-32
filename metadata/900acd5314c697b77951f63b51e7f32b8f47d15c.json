Free of her Rotring pens and scalpel, she now uses Photoshop to create her montages. Visual Alchemy explores McIntyreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sources of inspiration as well as her methods, offering an aesthetic guide to composition, color, texture and all of the other means of communication that artists have at their disposal. While these concepts and techniques make use of Photoshop, they will apply to any digital imaging program and indeed to any medium, whether traditional or digital. Featuring McIntyreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own art as well as that of artists around the globe, Visual Alchemy is an invitation to discover the artistic possibilities of picture making through digital montage.\n\n\nBy Catherine McIntyre\nPublished by Focal Press in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 240 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:900acd5314c697b77951f63b51e7f32b8f47d15c","amp;dn":"Visual+Alchemy+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"900acd5314c697b77951f63b51e7f32b8f47d15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,10,205,83,20,198,151,183,121,81,246,59,81,231,243,43,143,71,209,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
