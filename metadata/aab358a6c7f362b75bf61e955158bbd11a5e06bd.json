Their style ranged from Celtic-instrumental to blues to folk, always with a strong rhythmic feeling, and combined contemporary song stylings with traditional instrumentation and story elements. The principal songwriters were brothers Dave and Jeff Panting. Bagpiper Ian McKinnon was and is notable for his ability to play classic rock guitar riffs on Highland pipes. The instrumental combination of McKinnon\\&amp;#039;s warpipes with the Panting brothers\\&amp;#039; aggressively electrified mandolin and accordion made the appellation \\&quot;Celtic rock\\&quot; particularly apt for this band.\n\nAfter vocalist Joey Kitson joined the band in 1993, a number of the songs on the first two CDs, including \\&quot;Turn Of the Wheel\\&quot;, \\&quot;MacPherson\\&amp;#039;s Lament\\&quot;, \\&quot;Colleen\\&quot; and \\&quot;Open Road\\&quot; were recorded again with Kitson singing lead, and released on subsequent recordings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab358a6c7f362b75bf61e955158bbd11a5e06bd","amp;dn":"Rawlins+Cross+Reel+%5C%27n%5C%27+Roll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab358a6c7f362b75bf61e955158bbd11a5e06bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,179,88,166,199,243,98,183,91,246,30,149,81,88,187,209,26,94,6,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
