FLAC level 8 encoding via foobar2000.\n\nAmazon.com essential recording\n\n Cuban trumpeter JesÃƒÂºs AlemaÃƒÂ±y and his band strike again with a ripping album of hot Latin roots and jazz. As always, the mix is clean, hard-edged, and rarely lush. They mix together some of the more famous dance grooves of Cuba and Latin America, the mambo, the son, and the son montuno. The premier track is &quot;El Paso de Encarnacion,&quot; a hot guaracha from the old Orquesta AragÃƒÂ³n songbook. It's not a nostalgic look back, but just one example of how this band can stay away from pop fusion and still sound as contemporary as tomorrow. The band is outstanding. AlemaÃƒÂ±y's horn is always at the center of things, with the phenomenal Tata GÃƒÂ¼ines on congas, Emilio del Monte doing the timbales. Bassist Carlos del Puerto (formerly of Irakere) keeps the rhythm together with pianist Nachito Herrera and Carlos Godines's clave and gÃƒÂ¼iro. New to the group for this recording is a fine singer, Rolo Martinez. Notable solos are contributed by Orlando &quot;Maraca&quot; Valle on flute and Pancho Amat on tres. The arrangements are tight, the descarga (improv jams) are stunning, and the sound is at once rooted in the past and constantly looking forward. Album 3 and this band still shows no sign of getting tired or repeating themselves. --Louis Gibson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29cdf1982dd89142e04e817ab5aca78eb3b036cf","amp;dn":"Cubanismo+-+Reencarnaci%26oacute%3Bn+%281998%29+EAC+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29cdf1982dd89142e04e817ab5aca78eb3b036cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,205,241,152,45,216,145,66,224,78,129,122,181,172,167,142,179,176,54,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
