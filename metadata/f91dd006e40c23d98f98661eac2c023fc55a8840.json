We also report about how the Food and Drug Administration spent years obstructing a pharmaceutical company from honestly labeling their anti-depressant drug as dangerous to children.\n\nWe give advice to pregnant women about supplementation, provide methods to help women cope with endometriosis, and discuss some of the perverted practices in modern medicine that hearken back to the days when all doctors were men. We discuss how doctors in our society are treated like high priests, who are immune from suspicion, and who cannot be questioned, regardless of how they &quot;handle&quot; their female patients.\n\nWe explain why so many people have discolored teeth, and offer a safe way to whiten them. We inform listeners about the presence of fluoride in anti-depressant drugs, and how fluoride effects the mind. We also warn about fluoride's presence in the tap water, and its effects upon both creativity and intelligence. We expose that the Boy Scouts have abandoned their original ideals, and are instead teaching blind obedience. We warn about Internet spam &quot;feedback loops&quot;, which are used by unethical Internet providers, and advise people against drinking imported orange juice due to contamination by a fungicide that is used in some foreign countries.\n\nThis has been released by The Health Wyze Report.
