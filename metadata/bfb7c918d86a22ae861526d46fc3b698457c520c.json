This 1992 CTI release might get overlooked by hard bop fans because of producer Creed Taylor's tendency to either over-produce a session or turn it into commercial pabulum, but this out of print CD is worth acquiring.  &quot;Dailey Double,&quot; written by pianist Albert Dailey, is an up-tempo blues with a Latin kick.  The guitarist's lyricism comes to the forefront during a brisk reading of &quot;You Must Believe in Spring&quot; and a rather brief &quot;My Foolish Heart,&quot; featuring the leader on solo acoustic guitar.  Phil Woods makes a guest appearance on Wilkins' swirling bop composition &quot;Captain Blued&quot; and also bassist Harvie Swartz's &quot;Opal,&quot; stealing the spotlight on both tracks.  Chick Corea's &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; is a miniature that features Wilkins with guest guitarist Carl Barry.  A very enjoyable outing. ~ Ken Dryden, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nJack Wilkins (Guitar) \nAlbert Dailey (Piano) \nHarvie Swartz (Bass) \nAkira Tana (Drums) \nTed Moore (Percussion) \nPhil Woods (Alto Saxophone) - 4,10\nCarl Barry (Guitar) - 4\n\nJack Wilkins - Mexico Tracks:\n01  Daily Double (Albert Dailey/Dana Tria) 6:14 \n02  You Must Believe In Spring (Michel Legrand/Alan Bergman/Marilyn Bergman) 5:09 \n03  My Foolish Heart (Ned Washington/Victor Young) 1:48 \n04  Captain Blued (Jack Wilkins) 4:48 \n05  O Grande Amor (Antonio Carlos Jobim/Vinicius Moraes) 4:27 \n06  7th Variation On A Catalan Folk Song, Opus 25 (John Duarte) 1:13 \n07  Mexico (Harvie Swartz) 6:49 \n08  Captain Marvel (Chick Corea) 2:07 \n09  Streets Of Rio (Ted Moore) 6:40 \n10  Opal (Harvie Swartz) 5:09 \n11  Jamba (Jack Wilkins) 5:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfb7c918d86a22ae861526d46fc3b698457c520c","amp;dn":"Jack+Wilkins+-+Mexico+%281992%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfb7c918d86a22ae861526d46fc3b698457c520c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,183,201,24,216,106,34,174,134,21,38,212,111,195,182,152,69,124,82,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
