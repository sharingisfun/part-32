The sound is unfortunately terrible, \nyou should have a good idea what is going on there to actually enjoy the music but \nthe great footage makes up for that: Great unobstructed vision all way through, \nsupposedly shot from a gallery of some kind, decent close ups &amp; all band members \nget a fair share of closeups &amp; equal camera time. \nThis is an incredible item all in all -- very well worth a fan&amp;#039;s time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45b4a606e99418a0bb4c65f1ca5e1cbe3f7c20f1","amp;dn":"Seigmen+%2B+Motorpsycho+live+at+Quart+festival%2C+Norway+09-07-1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45b4a606e99418a0bb4c65f1ca5e1cbe3f7c20f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,180,166,6,233,148,24,160,187,76,101,241,202,94,28,190,63,124,32,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
