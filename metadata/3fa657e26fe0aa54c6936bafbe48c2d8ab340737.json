Hart is joined for the project by guests Patricia Hodge, Sarah Hadland, Tom Ellis and Kirstie Allsopp, while fitness instructor Amelia Watts provides some direction. Alongside new comedy sketches, the programme includes a cardio workout, a higher intensity cardio workout, strengthening exercises for the arms, core, legs and buttocks and a relaxation session. The emphasis is on fun throughout and the workouts are performed to some cheesy pop classics.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fa657e26fe0aa54c6936bafbe48c2d8ab340737","amp;dn":"Maracattack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fa657e26fe0aa54c6936bafbe48c2d8ab340737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,166,87,226,111,224,170,84,198,147,107,175,190,72,194,216,171,52,7,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
