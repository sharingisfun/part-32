But the challenge of playing with flawed humans, like a cat toying with a mouse, is endlessly amusing. If the devil loses a wager, though, he will harass a person's descendants until he eventually gets his due. Which is why he's tormenting Lee Fontana.\n\nThe night before Lee, a train robber, is paroled from jail, Satan terrifies and tempts the thief with the promise of one more successful heist. Struggling to live an honest life working on a farm in Southern California with old friends, opportunities to get rich quick seem to appear at every turn and the temptation becomes too much to bear. But Lee has a secret ally looking out for him. The prison cat Misto, a yellow-tabby ghost, will tail the ex-con on his dangerous missionÃ¢â‚¬â€an adventure that will leave a long legacy for everyone's favorite sleuthing cat, Joe Grey, and his pals in the charming California coastal town of Molina Point","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1363e53308b1e0d4fe312325a49ef39acd47df98","amp;dn":"Shirley+Rousseau+Murphy+%26amp%3B+Pat+J+J+Murphy+-The+Cat%2C+the+Devil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1363e53308b1e0d4fe312325a49ef39acd47df98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,99,229,51,8,177,224,212,254,49,35,37,164,158,243,154,205,71,223,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
