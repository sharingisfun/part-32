On this day, Anna comes back, ostensibly looking for a bracelet. She is the lead in his new production of Stindberg's &quot;A Dream Play.&quot; She talks of her hatred for her mother, now dead, an alcoholic actress, who was Vogler's star and lover. Vogler falls into a reverie, remembering a day Anna's mother, Rakel, late in life, came after rehearsal to beg him to come to her apartment. He awakes and Anna reveals the reason she has returned: she jolts him into an emotional response, rare for him, and the feelings of a young woman and an older man play out.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087193/\n\nTotal Streams:  2\nRunning Time:  1:10:03\nIndex Chunk:  Yes\nInterleaved:  No\nMax Bytes Per Sec:  0\nAUDIO: 0 - MP3 (0x55)\n     Average Bitrate Per Sec:  98 kb/s\n     Samples Rate:  32000 Hz\n     Channels:  2\n     Bits Per Sample:  0\n     Variable Bitrate:  Yes  (32, 64, 128)\nVIDEO:  DX50\n     B-VOP: No\n     S(GMC)-VOP: No\n     QuarterPixel: No\n     Frame Size:  608 x 400\n     Frames Rate:  25.000\n     Color Depth:  24\n     Total Frames:  105097","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4626fcc5f24a690042eb4a0a115007eeae39236a","amp;dn":"Efter+repetitionen+1984+Ingmar+Bergman+%5Bcin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4626fcc5f24a690042eb4a0a115007eeae39236a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,38,252,197,242,74,105,0,66,235,74,10,17,80,7,238,174,57,35,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
