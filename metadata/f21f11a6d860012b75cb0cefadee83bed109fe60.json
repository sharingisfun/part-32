It is their most successful, especially in the States, propelled by\nMTV video airplay. The first half of the album is a development of their\nunique brand of arena rock which had evolved in their music since the\n1980 album Making Movies, while the second half consists of more folkinfluenced\nmaterial. The whole album maintains the original Dire Straits'\nbluesy and laid back guitar-based sound whilst retaining a more lavish and\nbombastic production and overall sound. The album is the band's best\nselling album.\n\nBrothers in Arms was one of the first albums to be directed at the CD\nmarket, being the first full digital recording (DDD) released, although not\nthe first recording digitally recorded and mastered. It was also released on\nvinyl and cassette.\n\nBrothers in Arms was the first album to sell one million copies in the CD\nformat and to outsell its LP version. A Rykodisc staffer would subsequently\nwrite, &quot;[In 1985 we] were fighting to get our CDs manufactured because the\nentire worldwide manufacturing capacity was overwhelmed by demand for\na single rock title (Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms).&quot;\n\nIt was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue\nin 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000\nin the United States. It was also released in Super Audio CD format on July\n26, 2005 and DualDisc format on August 16, 2005, winning a Grammy for\nBest Surround Sound Album.\n\n\n   1. (05:12) - So Far Away\n   2.
