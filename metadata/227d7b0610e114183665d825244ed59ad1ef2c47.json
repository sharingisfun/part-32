Formed in 1995, the band notably comprises Ganzorig Nergui, Ganbold Muukhai and the lady musician Garavkhuu Badmaabazar. They are well aware that tradition is a living thing not to be confused with dead-still folklore, and this is clearly shown by Ganzorig NerguiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compositions featured on this album. They can just as well interpret ancient forms that were forbidden during socialist times, such as a magtaal praise song for a Buddhist deity, or innovate and use the tovshuur lute to interpret a tatlaga usually played on the morin khuur fiddle.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
