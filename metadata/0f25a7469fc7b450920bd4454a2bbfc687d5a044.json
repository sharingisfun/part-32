Five-time champion Arnold Schwarzenegger defends his Mr. Olympia title against Serge Nubret and the shy young deaf Lou Ferrigno, whose father is his coach; the ruthless champ psyches out the young lion. Sardinian Franco Columbu competes in the lightweight class; at home in Italy he solves a tight parking problem by lifting the car into place. Joe Weider is the marketer; Mike Katz and Ken Waller go for the title of Mr. Universe. Bodybuilding and a celebrity-to-be go mainstream.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f25a7469fc7b450920bd4454a2bbfc687d5a044","amp;dn":"Pumping+Iron+Deluxe+Edition+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f25a7469fc7b450920bd4454a2bbfc687d5a044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,37,167,70,159,199,180,80,146,11,212,69,74,43,191,198,135,213,160,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
