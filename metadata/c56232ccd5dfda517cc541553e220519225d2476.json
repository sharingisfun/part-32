The ever increasing miniaturization of digital electronic components is hampering the conventional testing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). Basically the very high scale of IC integration, with packages containing hundreds of pins at very small pitches down to a fraction of a millimeter, has made conventional testing impractical due to a lack of physical test access. Moreover Boundary-Scan will be applied in areas where test access will be a critical parameter such as Multi Chip Modules, waferscale integration and system testing.\nFollowing the evolution in IC test technology, Boundary-Scan Testing has become the new approach to PCB testing, and to other test access constrained assemblies. By taking precautions in the IC design (design for testability), testing at PCB level could be simplified to a great extent. This condition has been essential for the success of the introduction of Boundary-Scan Testing at board level.\nSince Boundary-Scan Testing involves the whole product life cycle, it is more than just the introduction of a new design technology.The benefits of Boundary-Scan such as time-to-market reduction, cost savings and quality improvement are discussed. It is an integral product approach which will support top management in their goal of achieving a successful global strategy for their business.\nThis book aims to aid companies that are introducing Boundary-Scan Test. IC design and test engineers alike will find the book an important introduction and guide to using Boundary-Scan Test in their work. Engineering managers can use this book to gain an insight at the impact that Boundary-Scan Test will make on their organisation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56232ccd5dfda517cc541553e220519225d2476","amp;dn":"Boundary-Scan+Test+-+A+Practical+Approach+-+Harry+Bleeker+-+Pete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56232ccd5dfda517cc541553e220519225d2476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,98,50,204,213,223,218,81,124,197,65,85,62,34,5,25,34,93,36,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
