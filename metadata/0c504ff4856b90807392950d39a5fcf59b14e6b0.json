The film stars Jock Mahoney, Gilbert Roland, Linda Cristal, Eduard Franz and Lorne Greene. Our overall rating for this film is: good. \nThe single most underrated of all great Westerns, a parable of redemption and renewal beautifully directed by George Sherman, an unacknowledged master of the genre, at the peak of his powers from a brilliant screenplay by David Harmon, and starring the superb Jock Mahoney and Gilbert Roland.\n\nWhen a millionaire discovers that he is going to lose half of his business if his missing brother isn't found to keep it out of the ruthless hands that want it, he sends the &quot;last of the fast guns&quot; out in search of him. Finding him won't be the hard thing for our gunfighter, however. Keeping him alive long enough to get back to the claim his share of the family business is going to be the tough part.\n\nThere is no movie more worthy of rediscovery--which would actually be first discovery for most people seeing it now.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.01gb\nDuration.... 01:18:39\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 306\nData Rate.... 1712kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c504ff4856b90807392950d39a5fcf59b14e6b0","amp;dn":"The+Last+of+the+Fast+Guns+1958+DvdRip+Avi+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c504ff4856b90807392950d39a5fcf59b14e6b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,80,79,244,133,107,144,128,115,146,149,13,57,165,252,245,155,20,230,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
