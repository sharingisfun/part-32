To Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, this is sacred ground. But to the Predators, it is hunting ground. Dark Horse Comics is proud to present Tarzan vs. Predator at the Earth's Core, by Walter Simonson and Lee Weeks. When Tarzan receives word that Pellucidar's greatest warriors and strongest beasts are being killed, and his friend David Innes, ruler of Pellucidar, has gone missing, there is no question that he must travel to the earth's core to investigate. The people of Pellucidar rest a little easier, knowing that their protector is coming. And in this land of eternal noonday sun, the Predators rest up for their greatest challenge yet!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1efe3f13af5541aefcbc3533c288a8801c57bf5a","amp;dn":"Tarzan+vs.+Predator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1efe3f13af5541aefcbc3533c288a8801c57bf5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,254,63,19,175,85,65,174,252,188,53,51,194,136,168,128,28,87,191,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
