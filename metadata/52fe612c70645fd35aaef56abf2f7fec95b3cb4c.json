The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass) and Matt Roberts (guitar). They took in guitarist Chris Henderson in the very early days of The Better Life's creation and released the album as a 4 piece band. Richard Liles played drums for the band during their touring stint on that record. From 2002 - 2005 The band hired Daniel Adair as a &quot;touring&quot; drummer and took off to play nearly 1000 shows as this formation all across the world in support of their hugely successful 'Away From The Sun' album.The band rose to international fame with their first single, &quot;Kryptonite&quot;, which charted in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band then signed onto Republic Records and released their debut album, The Better Life, in 2000. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of the year and was certified 6x platinum in the United States. Their second album, Away from the Sun, (2002) continued the band's success; it debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, went multi-platinum in the United States like its predecessor, and spawned the hits &quot;When I'm Gone&quot; and &quot;Here Without You&quot;. The band followed it up by extensive touring for two years before releasing their third album, Seventeen Days, in 2005. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum within its first month of release. Their fourth, self-titled album, 3 Doors Down (2008), also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band's fifth studio album, Time of My Life (2011) debuted at No. 3 at the charts.\n&quot;Kryptonite&quot; is a song by the American rock band 3 Doors Down. It was originally released as a demo for local play by 97.9 WCPR-FM in Biloxi, Mississippi. It charted well internationally and peaked at #3 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was written by drummer/vocalist Brad Arnold in a mathematics class when he was fifteen and was one of the first songs he ever wrote.In terms of the song's meaning Arnold has said: &quot;That song seems like it's really just kind of like asking a question. Its question is kind of a strange one. It's not just asking, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I fall down, will you be there for me?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Because it's easy to be there for someone when they're down. But it's not always easy to be there for somebody when they're doing good. And that's the question it's asking. It's like, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It's asking, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I'm down, will you still be there for me?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But at the same time, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That's kind of asking, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I'm doing good, will you be there for me? Will you not be jealous of me?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That's the basic question that song's asking, and maybe throughout the years of singing that song, I might have come up with more meanings for it than it actually might have originally had. After the song's release, it began to garner significant radio play. This allowed it to reach its high position in the charts and give 3 Doors Down their breakthrough hit. As a result of the popularity of the single, along with the fame of the other less known singles, The Better Life went on to sell over six million copies. The song still remains 3 Doors Down's best known song to this day, and many fans consider it to be their signature song. The song plays during the freestyle of Superman monster truck at Monster Jam events. The song first charted on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart hitting number 1 for 9 weeks, then it hit the Modern Rock Tracks also hitting number 1 at an outstanding 11 weeks being one of the longest-running songs on the chart. It also hit number 1 on the Pop Songs chart for 5 non-consecutive weeks, it hit number 4 on the Adult Top 40 chart and hit number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart being the band's highest charting single there.\n\nLyrics\n\n&quot;Kryptonite&quot;\n\nI took a walk around the world\nTo ease my troubled mind\nI left my body lying somewhere\nIn the sands of time\nBut I watched the world float\nTo the dark side of the moon\n\nI feel there is nothing I can do, yeah\n\nI watched the world float\nTo the dark side of the moon\nAfter all I knew it had to be\nSomething to do with you\nI really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind what happens now and then\nAs long as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be my friend at the end\n\nIf I go crazy then will you still\nCall me Superman\nIf IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alive and well, will you be\nThere a-holding my hand\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll keep you by my side\nWith my superhuman might\nKryptonite\n\nYou called me strong, you called me weak,\nBut still your secrets I will keep\nYou took for granted all the times\nI never let you down\nYou stumbled in and bumped your head,\nIf not for me then you'd be dead\nI picked you up and put you back on solid ground\n\nIf I go crazy then will you still\nCall me Superman\nIf IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alive and well,\nWill you be there a-holding my hand\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll keep you by my side\nWith my superhuman might\nKryptonite\n\nIf I go crazy then will you still\nCall me Superman\nIf IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alive and well, will you be there\nHolding my hand\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll keep you by my side\nWith my superhuman might\nKryptonite\nYeah!!\n\nIf I go crazy then will you still\nCall me Superman\nIf I'm alive and well,\nWill you be there a-holding my hand\nI'll keep you by my side\nWith my superhuman might\nKryptonite\n\nOh, whoa, whoa\nOh, whoa, whoa\nOh, whoa, whoa\n\nVideo:\nFrame Width: 1280\nFrame Height: 720\nData Rate: 2509kbps\nTotal Bitrate: 3123kbps\nFrame Rate: 29 FPS\n\nAudio:\nTrack I\nDolby Pro Logic II\nBit Rate: 384kbps\nChannels 2(stereo)\nAudio Sample Rate: 48 khz\n\nTrack 2\n7.1 ch mix\nBit Rate: 1536kbps\nAudio Sample Rate: 48 khz\n\nThumbnails: \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52fe612c70645fd35aaef56abf2f7fec95b3cb4c","amp;dn":"3+Doors+Down+-+Kryptonite+%28LIVE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52fe612c70645fd35aaef56abf2f7fec95b3cb4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,254,97,44,112,100,95,211,90,174,245,106,191,47,127,236,149,179,203,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
