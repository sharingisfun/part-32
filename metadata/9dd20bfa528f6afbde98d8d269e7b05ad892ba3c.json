The canon of fifty greatest funnies runs from The Gold Rush and Duck Soup to Airplane and Shaun of the Dead, plus double-acts, drag-acts and ensembles from Laurel &amp; Hardy and the Marx Bros, to the Pythons and the Coen Brothers. Seeking out the films that have amused people the most - or simply amused the most people - the Rough Guide gives you the ultimate lowdown on laughter in the movies from Wes Anderson''s Rushmore to Withnail and I, and from John Belushi to Billy Wilder.\n\n\nPaperback: 312 pages\nPublisher: Rough Guides (October 17, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1843534649\nISBN-13: 978-1843534648","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd20bfa528f6afbde98d8d269e7b05ad892ba3c","amp;dn":"The+Rough+Guide+to+Comedy+Movies+1+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd20bfa528f6afbde98d8d269e7b05ad892ba3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,210,11,250,82,143,106,251,222,152,216,210,105,231,176,90,216,146,186,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
