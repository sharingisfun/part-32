This volume, the first collection of major documents addressing Malcolm X in decades, features never-before-published material, including articles from major newspapers and underground presses, oral histories, police reports, and FBI files, to shine a brighter light on Malcolm's life and times. Conceived as both a companion to the biography and a standalone volume, and assembled by Marable and his key researcher, Garrett Felber, prior to Marable's untimely death, The Portable Malcolm X Reader presents an invaluable portrait of Malcolm X.\r\n\r\nFor more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
