Nirvana was the fourth Nirvana album to be released following the death of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain in April 1994, and the first to feature studio material. It contains the previously unreleased &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;, a song recorded during the band's final studio session from January 1994. The album also includes a selection of the band's more popular songs, pulled mostly from 1991's Nevermind and 1993's In Utero, but also containing three pre-Nevermind songs and two recorded during the band's MTV Unplugged set in late 1993. Nirvana opened at #3 on the Billboard 200. The album sold more than 6 million copies worldwide and by early 2009, it sold more than 2 million copies in the U.S. alone according to Soundscan.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Kim Hughes - Essentially a greatest-hits collection with one previously unreleased song, &quot;You Know You're Right,&quot; and producer Scott Litt's 1994 remix of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea,&quot; Nirvana the album is nevertheless a welcome addition to the band's canon. Crisp, elegant liner notes by Rolling Stone writer David Fricke put us squarely in Kurt Cobain's mindset as he entered a Seattle studio in January 1994--a full two days later than expected--to record what would be his final session with Nirvana. The resulting &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; locates Cobain at the apogee of his disenfranchisement with tongue nevertheless planted firmly in cheek. Bawdy, raucous, and venomous, &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; could have been lifted from Nevermind. A mix of tracks from that album (&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; &quot;Come as You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; and &quot;In Bloom&quot;) sits opposite stuff from early EPs and the Bleach disc (&quot;About a Girl,&quot; &quot;Been a Son,&quot; and &quot;Sliver&quot;), plus two from the MTV Unplugged sessions and several more from In Utero. Not the Nirvana treasure chest we hoped for, but solid nonetheless.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] You Know You're Right\n[02] About A Girl\n[03] Been A Son\n[04] Sliver\n[05] Smells Like Teen Spirit\n[06] Come As You Are\n[07] Lithium\n[08] In Bloom\n[09] Heart-Shaped Box\n[10] Pennyroyal Tea\n[11] Rape Me\n[12] Dumb\n[13] All Apologies\n[14] The Man Who Sold The World\n[15] Where Did You Sleep Last Night\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 00h:54m:41s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 371mb (Including FLACs, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Grunge Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 29 October 2002\nRecord Company\t&gt; Geffen Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://hereisnirvana.com \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29 \n\t&gt; http://www.nirvana-music.com/nirvana-best-of-album-lyrics.html \n\t&gt;[Smells Like Teen Spirit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ TOTP Alt Version]\n\t&gt;[Lithium]\n\t&gt;[Come As You Are]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28f7d0cf745440e4943da86a2d0fa4b695c65d96","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Nirvana+-+Nirvana+371mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28f7d0cf745440e4943da86a2d0fa4b695c65d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,247,208,207,116,84,64,228,148,61,168,106,45,15,164,182,149,198,93,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
