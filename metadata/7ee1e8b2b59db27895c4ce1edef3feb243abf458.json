The sound recorder program is\n              designed to work with your sound card directly and smoothly, so it\n              can record almost all audio streaming from your sound card with\n              perfect quality. It can record sound from sources including\n              microphone, line-in, stereo mixer, mono out, etc., and also audio\n              streaming from any other programs (like WinAMP, Real One Player, \n              Windows Media Player, and so on.)\n\n              Direct to disk function enables you to record sound without running \n              out of memory as long as there is enough disk space available. \n              HiRecord can also record directly to MP3 format that you may set from\n              the options dialog, and it will save your valuable disk space. You\n              could select the different MP3 recording modes when needed.\n\n              HiRecorder is also a great way to record streaming music from the\n              popular Digital Music Services and more:\n\n              * LAUNCHcast\n              * Real Radio\n              * Pandora\n\n              Best Features\n\n              * Record high quality MP3s from online radio and music services\n              \n              * Direct to disk ability allows you to record without stopping\n              \n              * Make individual song files split precisely and accurately into\n                separate tracks\n                \n              * Stop Recording automatically\n              \n              * Support recording to mp3 file directly without creating any\n                temporary files\n                \n              * Easy to use playback function\n              \n              * Automatically tags songs with title, artist, album and genre\n                information\n              \n              * Single Task Schedule\n              \n              * File Length Limitation System\n              \n              * Real-time oscilloscope\n              \n              * Record-Pause function\n              \n              * Ease of use interface\n              \n              * Operation Indicators\n              \n              * ID3 Tag Editor\n\n              blah, blah, blah...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee1e8b2b59db27895c4ce1edef3feb243abf458","amp;dn":"HiRecorder.1.00.Incl.Keygen-ONY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee1e8b2b59db27895c4ce1edef3feb243abf458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,225,232,178,181,157,178,120,149,196,206,30,222,243,254,178,67,171,244,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
