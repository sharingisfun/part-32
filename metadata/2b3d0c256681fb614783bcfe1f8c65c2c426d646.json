The mellow, country-folk flavor of the opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ArmsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the claphappy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leaving, For The Last TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ took a few listens to really sink in. But SylvieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant voice and delicate melodies elevate even the most simple of tunes to a higher level.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ArmsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in particular gets better each time I hear it. The song is both an ode to Bob Dylan himself and a relishing of the comfort found in any beloved piece of music.\n\nMany of the other songs also take their inspiration from other artists. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leaving, For The Last TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was born from SylvieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first viewing of William BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawing Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Reluctant Soul Leaving The Body,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ while Ã¢â‚¬Å“KindnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is about Sylvia PlathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to protect her children from her own suicide.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Song I Sang Before I Met You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which I shared earlier this month, was co-written by UK electro-pop singer Gary Go.\nThe bright and lovely Ã¢â‚¬Å“Summer SaltÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ named for a studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playful misspelling of somersault Ã¢â‚¬â€œ recalls the lilting dreaminess of Translations.\n\nThe sublime Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Fish &amp; The BirdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ follows. A jaunty fable of star-crossed love with just the softest, lightest hint of jazz, it is the stand out track on the album. You can watch the video for the song below.\n\nThe whimsical NYC interlude Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DoormanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ leads into the fantastic Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of Honeymouth.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The latter tale of a Southern Casanova mingles a genteel, tinkling piano melody with a retro girl pop chorus.\n\nSylvieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful cover of the Italian song Ã¢â‚¬Å“GocceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is perfectly paired with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Streets of Rome,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which features Sondre Lerche.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s All True closes with a reworked rendition of the traditional folk song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Give Me The Roses Now.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b3d0c256681fb614783bcfe1f8c65c2c426d646","amp;dn":"Sylvie+Lewis+-+It%27s+All+True+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC.CUE.LOG%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b3d0c256681fb614783bcfe1f8c65c2c426d646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,61,12,37,102,129,251,97,71,131,188,254,31,140,101,194,196,38,214,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
