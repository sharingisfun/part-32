Featuring an in depth chronological view into old live clips, all the way from their demo stages going right through every release upto the present era in Therion, and of course the mildly entertaining back stage tom foolery is included.\n\nCover\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIpjaAed&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAIpjaAed&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0108991a1c76c860bf3d0fe2a265844cd3b5607c","amp;dn":"Therion+-+Celebrators+of+Becoming+-+2006+%284xDVD9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0108991a1c76c860bf3d0fe2a265844cd3b5607c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,8,153,26,28,118,200,96,191,61,15,226,162,101,132,76,211,181,96,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
