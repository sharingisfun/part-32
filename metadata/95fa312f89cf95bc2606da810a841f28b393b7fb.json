It contains:\n\n\nDoom 64\nDoom (Ultimate of course)\nDoom 2\nFinal Doom TNT Evilution\nFinal Doom Plutonia Experiment\nHeretic\nHexen\nStrife - Quest for the Sigil (with voices and Legacy of Strife fanmod)\nHACX (cancelled ID game. Never saw daylight. Fanmade recreation here)\n\nPlus, the following unofficial expansions for Doom:\n\nMemento Mori \nHell Revealed \nHell Revealed 2 \nRequiem \nThe Darkening \nAlien Vendetta\nDoom Odyssey\nDark 7\n\n\nExcluding Doom 64, all Doom games are running with Hi-Res textures packs, sprite textures (not ugly 3d models), Hi-quality MP3 music (instead of old MIDI music) AND with Brutal Mod by Sergeant_Mark_IV. This mod brings ultra stylish gore, with tons of well-made new moves, fatalities (!) and animations. \n\nInstead of Brutal Doom, you can activate for all Doom games Project MSX mod, with\nmodified enemies, weapons and some system changes to boot. Theme based on Halo and Crysis.\n\nNo bugs with mods. No shitty one level wads or crappy wad selection and call it a Collection. I've built an launcher on C# to avoid headaches with configurations, settings, mods and bla bla. Just run the launcher and hit a button to start the damn thing :)\n\n\n--Changelog over old version:\n\nProject MSX added\nNew Textures added\nNew model textures\nNew laucher updated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95fa312f89cf95bc2606da810a841f28b393b7fb","amp;dn":"Best+ID+Collectors+Edition+%28Final+Ver.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95fa312f89cf95bc2606da810a841f28b393b7fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,250,49,47,137,207,149,188,38,6,218,129,10,132,31,40,179,147,183,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
