Author Jack Purdum uses knowledge gained from more than 25 years of teaching experience to give you this thorough, yet easy-to-understand introduction to object-oriented programming with C#. Each chapter reinforces the programming philosophy and concepts of object-oriented programming, while real-world situations demonstrate how to design, create, test, and deliver your programs. With this engaging and motivating book, you will be eager to start writing programs right away.\n\nBeginning Object-Oriented Programming with C#:\n- Teaches programming language fundamentals using C# with Visual Studio 2012 as the programming environment\n- Helps you fully understand how reference and value data types differ and how those differences affect your programs\n- Walks you through designing and writing object-oriented programs and custom classes\n- Explores various types of program errors; explains how to detect, isolate, and correct such errors; and addresses how to prevent further errors using defensive coding techniques\n- Teaches you advanced features such as database programming, inheritance, and polymorphism\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: Getting Started\nChapter 1.
