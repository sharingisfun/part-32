Yes, that&amp;#039;s right, I said it.  Stop laughing.  By all means up a better one for us to enjoy.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s stuff from as far back as the mid 50s and all the way up to now (2008).  There&amp;#039;s Classic Rock, Hard Rock, Metal, Light Rock, Hair Bands, Grunge, Angry Chick Rock, Modern Rock...  you name it, it&amp;#039;s probably represented.  It ranges from soft stuff like Simon &amp; Garfunkle to Hard stuff like Metallica.  What isn&amp;#039;t there is stuff that shouldn&amp;#039;t be... there&amp;#039;s no R&amp;B, no Funk, no Country, no Rap, etc.  I mention this since I&amp;#039;ve seen this in other &quot;Rock&quot; torrents with songs from those genres in them.  Not here.  \n\nIt&amp;#039;s collected from my own collections and various other best of/greatest rock torrents, all scrutinized by none other than me! :-D  I&amp;#039;m from the USA, so there&amp;#039;s not going to be a bunch of Euro rock (sorry guys) as there&amp;#039;s already plenty of those torrents out there filled with music I&amp;#039;ve never heard of.  This torrent is for folks looking for an alternative to that.\n\nAll songs normalized to the same volume (93 Db).  All are 192kbps mp3 format (some vbr) with the exception of 46 files @160kbps and 2 @128kbps \n\nFeel free to critique, I&amp;#039;m always looking for more good music.  Whittling it down to 1000 songs is not easy though, alot of good stuff was left out.\n\nbtw - I uploaded a 645 song, rock torrent recently and immediately decided that it wasn&amp;#039;t good enough.  So, this has all of those songs (higher bitrates re-encoded to 192 for this torrent) plus another 355 additions.  Apologies to anyone who already got that one.  This one is much better!\n\nAlso, if interested, I also upped a 50&amp;#039;s &amp; 60&amp;#039;s Oldies torrent (226 songs) earlier today:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4254617/226_50s__amp__60s_Oldies_(USA)_(192kbps)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4254617/226_50s__amp__60s_Oldies_(USA)_(192kbps)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db5351581977256cdf407895aadb419fe640c4b","amp;dn":"50+Years+of+Rock+-+1000+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db5351581977256cdf407895aadb419fe640c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,181,53,21,129,151,114,86,205,244,7,137,90,173,180,25,254,100,12,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
