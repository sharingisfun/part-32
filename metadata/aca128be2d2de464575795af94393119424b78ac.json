Arsenal ended a five-match losing streak against Chelsea with a 3-1 home victory when the sides \nlast met, in December. However, the Gunners have made their worst start to a season in more than half a century, \nwhile Chelsea have made a smooth transition under new manager Andre Villas Boas. The key man in this fixture \ncould be Didier Drogba, who has scored 13 goals in his last 12 appearances against Arsenal. Another forward, \nWayne Rooney of Manchester United, is likely to be the focus of attention on his return to previous club Everton. \nThe day's other fixtures include Manchester City v Wolves, West Brom v Liverpool and Sunderland v Aston Villa.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca128be2d2de464575795af94393119424b78ac","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+29th+October+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca128be2d2de464575795af94393119424b78ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,161,40,190,45,45,228,100,87,87,149,175,148,57,49,25,66,75,120,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
