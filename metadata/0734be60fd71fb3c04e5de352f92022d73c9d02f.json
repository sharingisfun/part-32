Each of the fifty-five physicists profiled have made important contributions to physics, through their ideas and teaching, or in other ways. The biographies are arranged chronologically by the physicists' dates of birth, so that, when read in sequence, they convey how physics developed over time. However, the book emphasizes their varied life stories, not the details of their achievements. Ioan James is Professor at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. He is the author of Remarkable Mathematicians (Cambridge University Press, 2003) and Topological and Uniform Spaces (Springer-Verlag, 1999).\n\n\n# Paperback: 406 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (January 12, 2004)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521017068\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521017060","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0734be60fd71fb3c04e5de352f92022d73c9d02f","amp;dn":"Remarkable+Physicists%3A+From+Galileo+to+Yukawa+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0734be60fd71fb3c04e5de352f92022d73c9d02f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,52,190,96,253,113,251,60,4,229,222,53,47,146,2,45,115,201,208,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
