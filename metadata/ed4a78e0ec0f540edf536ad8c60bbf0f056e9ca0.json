Besides Morello, the album also includes appearances on several songs by Clarence Clemons, who passed away in 2011, and Danny Federici, who passed away in 2008, on what Springsteen calls &quot;some of our best unreleased material from the past decade.&quot; The album was recorded in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Australia and New York City and marks Springsteen's 18th studio album. As Bruce writes in the albums liner notes, &quot;I felt they were among the best of my writing and deserved a proper studio recording.&quot; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4a78e0ec0f540edf536ad8c60bbf0f056e9ca0","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+High+Hopes+%5Bmp3-vbr-2014%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4a78e0ec0f540edf536ad8c60bbf0f056e9ca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,74,120,224,236,15,84,14,223,83,106,216,198,11,191,15,5,110,156,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
