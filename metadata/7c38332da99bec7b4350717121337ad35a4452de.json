(Flash Player 4.0 r7, Macromedia, Inc.)\n\nMost of the games are self-explanatory. Those based on the arcade\ngames by the same name offer gameplay that is true to the arcade\nmachines upon which they are based. The &quot;Napster Bad&quot; technically\nIS NOT a game, but I couldn&amp;#039;t resist adding it because it is\nfunnay as hell (and I needed something to fill out Arcade Pack #1).\nSnake is a clone of that infamous Nokia Cell Phone Game.\n\nInstall, enjoy and look for more PfP Arcade Packs and other\nreleases soon.\n\nPfP - October 18, 2007\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c38332da99bec7b4350717121337ad35a4452de","amp;dn":"PfP+Arcade+Pack+%231+%28PfP%29+-+Asteroids%2C+Hexxagon%2C+Pac-Man%2C+Simon%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c38332da99bec7b4350717121337ad35a4452de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,56,51,45,169,155,236,123,67,80,113,113,33,51,122,211,90,68,82,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
