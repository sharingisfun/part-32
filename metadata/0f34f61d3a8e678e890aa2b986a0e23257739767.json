Dance Gavin Dance incorporates many different musical genres into their palette, such as screamo, funk, soul and more recently hip-hop on top of its post-hardcore sound. Ex-vocalist Jonny Craig also received high marks for contributing to the band's unorthodox soul sound and guitarist Will Swan has been recognized for his intricate, fast-moving guitar licks and riffs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f34f61d3a8e678e890aa2b986a0e23257739767","amp;dn":"Dance+Gavin+Dance-Happiness%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f34f61d3a8e678e890aa2b986a0e23257739767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,52,246,29,58,142,103,142,137,10,162,185,134,160,226,50,87,115,151,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
