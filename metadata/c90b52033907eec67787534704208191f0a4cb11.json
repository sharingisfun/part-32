It tells the story of a nurse whose empty life is changed by her patient, John, who expands her understanding of Christmas. &quot;The Forgotten Carols&quot; are original songs from the perspective of characters such as the innkeeper who turned the young couple away or the shepherd who slept through the angel&amp;#039;s announcement. Their personal accounts, until now, have been overlooked or ignored. Together, John and Constance discover what the world has forgotten about Christmas.
