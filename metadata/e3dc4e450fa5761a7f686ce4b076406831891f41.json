Although the series borrows many elements from previous Batman storylines, it does not follow the continuity set by the comic books, the film series, nor that of the previous Batman: The Animated Series or its spin-offs. The character designs were provided by Jackie Chan Adventures artist Jeff Matsuda and was noticeably lighter in tone than the previous animated series, depicting Batman as more lighthearted with a dry, ironic wit.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3dc4e450fa5761a7f686ce4b076406831891f41","amp;dn":"The+Batman+Strikes%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3dc4e450fa5761a7f686ce4b076406831891f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,220,78,69,15,165,118,26,127,104,108,228,176,118,64,104,49,137,31,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
