It peaked at #1 and #3 on Billboard's \nHeatseekers and Billboard 200 albums charts, respectively. \nIt was the band's best selling album, and was certified 5x \nPlatinum by the RIAA.\n\nIt was remastered and reissued in 2011 as a twenty-year \nanniversary edition, with a bonus track added to the original \nalbum and a second disc of demos previously released only on \ncassette, plus two live tracks.\n\nThe album's title is a reference to Kryptonite, a fictional \nsubstance from the Superman comic book series. The title is \ntaken from the album's opening track, &quot;Jimmy Olsen's Blues&quot;\na reference to Superman supporting character Jimmy Olsen, \nwho is attracted to Lois Lane and jealous of her romantic \nfeelings for Superman. The cover, showing a phone booth, \nrefers to Clark Kent frequently ducking into a nearby phone \nbooth to change into his Superman attire.\n\nFile Format:  FLAC\nCodec: LAME 3.99.5\nNumber of Albums: 01\nNumber of Tracks: 13\nVersion: MPEG 1 Layer III\nChannels: 2 Channels Stereo / 44100 Hz\nQuality:  [FLAC avg. bitrate: 909 kbps]\nAlbum Title: Pocket Full Of Kryptonite\nArtist / Group: Spin Doctors\nAlbum Release Year: 1992\nArtwork: Embedded Within Audio Files\nGenre: Alternative rock / Funk rock / Power pop \nTotal Size: 461.4365 MB \nTotal Duration: 01h:10m:28s:997ms\nRipper:FLAC  Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 3 - Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d22.e-loader.net/rWqrh0nYji.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d22.e-loader.net/rWqrh0nYji.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d12.e-loader.net/ETcOHyVytq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d12.e-loader.net/ETcOHyVytq.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d4.e-loader.net/uUl0LZanml.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d4.e-loader.net/uUl0LZanml.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Jimmy Olsen's Blues[4mn 38s ][ 910 Kbps ][ 30.5 MiB ] \n02 - What Time Is It?[4mn 50s ][ 875 Kbps ][ 30.5 MiB ] \n03 - Little Miss Can't Be Wrong[3mn 54s ][ 924 Kbps ][ 26.1 MiB ] \n04 - Forty Or Fifty[4mn 23s ][ 865 Kbps ][ 27.4 MiB ] \n05 - Refrigerator Car[4mn 46s ][ 947 Kbps ][ 32.5 MiB ] \n06 - More Than She Knows[2mn 12s ][ 927 Kbps ][ 14.8 MiB ] \n07 - Two Princes[4mn 17s ][ 956 Kbps ][ 29.6 MiB ] \n08 - Off My Line[3mn 59s ][ 958 Kbps ][ 27.6 MiB ] \n09 - How Could You Want Him [When You Know You Could Have Me?][4mn 59s ][ 871 Kbps ][ 31.3 MiB ] \n10 - Shinbone Alley / Hard To Exist[12mn 42s ][ 932 Kbps ][ 85.0 MiB ] \n11 - Yo Mamas A Pajama[4mn 2s ][ 936 Kbps ][ 27.3 MiB ] \n12 - Sweet Widow[11mn 38s ][ 866 Kbps ][ 72.4 MiB ] \n13 - Stepped On A Crack[4mn 2s ][ 906 Kbps ][ 26.4 MiB ] \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004d9e89884f0206a4fa48210b1de467b0a701fe","amp;dn":"Spin+Doctors+-+Pocket+Full+Of+Kryptonite+1992+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004d9e89884f0206a4fa48210b1de467b0a701fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,77,158,137,136,79,2,6,164,250,72,33,11,29,228,103,176,167,1,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
