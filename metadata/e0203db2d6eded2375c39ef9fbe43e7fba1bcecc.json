After leaving Van Halen, Roth started his own career as a solo artist. His early albums were well received, but starting in the early 1990s, subsequent releases fared successively worse as popular musical tastes changed and Roth\\'s band underwent numerous personnel changes.\n\n\n\\&quot;Just a Gigolo\\&quot; is a popular song, adapted by Irving Caesar in 1929 from the Austrian song \\&quot;SchÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶ner Gigolo\\&quot;, written in 1928 by Leonello Casucci (music) and Julius Brammer (lyrics).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0203db2d6eded2375c39ef9fbe43e7fba1bcecc","amp;dn":"David+Lee+Roth+-+Just+A+Gigolo%2C+I+Ain%60T+Got+%5Btntvillage.scambioe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0203db2d6eded2375c39ef9fbe43e7fba1bcecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,32,61,178,214,237,237,35,117,195,158,249,251,228,62,127,186,27,206,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
