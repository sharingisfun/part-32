A lot of crazy stuff happens, for example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\nDirected By: Paris Barclay\n\nMPAA: Rated &quot; R &quot; For Strong Language, Sexuality, Some Drug Content And Violence.\n\nRuntime: 1 Hour, 30 Minutes, 17 Seconds\n\nGenre: Comedy / Crime\n\nPlot Keywords: Friends / Gun / Family Relationships / Long Title / Uzi\n\nCountry: USA\n\nLanguage: English\n\nColor: Color\n\nResolution: 608 x 336\n\nFormat: Original Widescreen Presentation ( Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1 )\n\nSound Mix: Dolby Digital 2.0 ( AC3, 192 Kbps )\n\nSystem Source: PAL Version\n\nXviD Codec Version: 1.2.1\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n                           Ripped &amp; Encoded By: Booster2\n                           =============================\n\n\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29a3facb165aa5fea863b2a2908f26dffb7780c","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t+Be+A+Menace+%28A+Paris+Barclay+Film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29a3facb165aa5fea863b2a2908f26dffb7780c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,154,63,172,177,101,170,95,234,134,59,42,41,8,242,109,255,183,120,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
