Not by coincidence, a mysterious videotape falls into the hands of Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw and Bob Andrews during JupiterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birthday party in Rocky Beach. On it is a recording of JupiterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s long dead parents. In their message they want to communicate to their son the key to an especially tricky riddle. The Three Investigators do not hesitate for a second: immediately, they make their way to the abandoned property of the mad inventor Terrill, located in a lonesome wood in Northern California.\n\nGenre: Adventure | Family | Mystery\nIMDB rating: 6.1/10 (90 votes)\nDirected by: Florian Baxmeyer\nStarring: Chancellor Miller, Nick Price, Cameron Monaghan\n\nRelease Name: The.Three.Investigators.And.The.Secret.Of.Terror.Castle.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF\nSize: 700MB\nAudio Quality: MP3 VBR 128kbps\nVideo Quality: XviD 25fps 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€272 915kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d75f6684f1aebe3920f107da07355e073e10cd90","amp;dn":"The+Three+Investigators+And+The+Secret+Of+Terror+Castle+2009+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d75f6684f1aebe3920f107da07355e073e10cd90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,95,102,132,241,174,190,57,32,241,7,218,7,53,94,7,62,16,205,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
