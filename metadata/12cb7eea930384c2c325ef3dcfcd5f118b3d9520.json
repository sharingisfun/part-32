It was written in the style of an Italian comedy, which means that the most important plot points were thought of before, but the rest was improvisation. This makes the plot sometimes a bit messy, but overall I think they managed quite well. I hope that you enjoy this release.\n\nHave a nice read!\n\nThis is a remastered version of the pack I uploaded. I translated the cover too, added a hind page, and re-compressed the pages since the old compression method (ACE) apparently gave some problems with ComicRack.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other translated Belgian/French comics, you can check my release thread:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced.
