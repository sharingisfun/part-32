Harold Budd's piano playing and Eno's production and treatments complement each other perfectly, giving rise to a truly spectacular ambient music experience. Eno's goal for ambient music was to create music that was rewarding to listen to either at low or normal volumes, and that's certainly the case here. I love all kinds of music, but ambient music can't be beat as a background for working or reading (which was the intention). This music is also good for meditating or for having in the background when talking with friends. It's relaxing, lyrical, beautiful, and uplifting. I've known about Eno for a long time, but I wasn't familiar with Harold Budd before the Ambient series. Strongly recommended.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
