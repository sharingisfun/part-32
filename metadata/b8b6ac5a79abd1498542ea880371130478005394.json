You travel between planets on mundane assignments, only to return to your home station to find the place a complete wreck, courtesy of an evil alien race. All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell.\n\nRLH encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter. You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened.\n\nEnemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small &quot;grunt&quot; type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you. Each has it's own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge.\n\nIn a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn't much puzzle solving and not much slow times. The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title. When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked... that's why you must &quot;run like hell&quot;.\n\nRLH features celebrity voice actors, such as Lance Henriksen (Frank Black from TV's &quot;Millenium&quot;), Michael Ironside (bad guy from Total Recall), Kate Mulgrew (Star Trek Voyager's Captain Janeway) and Brad Douriff, the voice of Chucky from the Child's Play movies.\n\nYou will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* A thrilling 3rd person sci-fi adventure. \n\n* An intense storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat. \n\n* Incredible voice-acting work by top Hollywood talent including Lance Henriksen, \n  Kate Mulgrew, Clancy   Brown and more. \n\n* Intelligent alien foes that learn from your actions to become even more \n  dangerous. \n\n* 7 gripping chapters of action-packed gameplay. \n\n* The powerful game engine brings to life characters, objects and environments in\n  full 3D. \n\n* Dynamic camera perspectives create a truly cinematic experience. \n \n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media\nisn't working.\n\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b6ac5a79abd1498542ea880371130478005394","amp;dn":"Run+Like+Hell+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b6ac5a79abd1498542ea880371130478005394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,182,172,90,121,171,209,73,133,66,234,136,3,113,19,4,120,0,83,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
