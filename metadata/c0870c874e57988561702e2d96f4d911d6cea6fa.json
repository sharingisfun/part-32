Taking on the most dangerous and daring operations, the rogues and misfits of the elite X-Wing unit became legends of the Rebellion and the Second Galactic Civil War, before breaking up and going their separate ways. Now their singular skills are back in vital demandÃ¢â‚¬â€for a tailor-made Wraith Squadron mission.\n\nA powerful general in the Galactic Alliance Army, once renowned for his valor, is suspected of participating in the infamous Lecersen Conspiracy, which nearly toppled the Alliance back into the merciless hands of the Empire. With orders to expose and apprehend the traitorÃ¢â‚¬â€and license to do so by any and all meansÃ¢â‚¬â€the Wraiths will become thieves, pirates, impostors, forgers . . . and targets, as they put their guts, their guns, and their riskiest game plan to the test against the most lethal of adversaries.\n\nunabridged\n192kbps &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/X-wing:_Mercy_Kill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/X-wing:_Mercy_Kill&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0870c874e57988561702e2d96f4d911d6cea6fa","amp;dn":"Aaron+Allston+-+Star+Wars+-+X-Wing+-+Mercy+Kill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0870c874e57988561702e2d96f4d911d6cea6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,135,12,135,78,87,152,133,97,112,46,45,150,244,217,17,214,206,166,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
