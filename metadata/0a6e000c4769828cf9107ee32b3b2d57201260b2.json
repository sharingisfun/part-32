Not only is he one of today's fastest rising actors, he's also one of the most hysterical stand-up comedians on the scene. Returning to his hometown of Cincinnati, Williams says and does exactly what he feels, provoking nonstop laughter on everything from sex, relationships and parethood to his shattered L.A. illusions. In his first full-length solo DVD, Williams connects with his audience like few other comedians as he pipms out some street-savvy advice and outrageously funny observations.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate                         : 2 068 Kbps\nWidth                            : 600 pixels\nHeight                           : 450 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.256\nStream size                      : 1.23 GiB (90%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 25mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 136 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 32 ms (0.96 video frame)\n\n\nUploader's Note: The subtitles included are in English.
