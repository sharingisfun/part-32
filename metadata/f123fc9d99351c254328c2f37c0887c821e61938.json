The process which picked up tempo after the Shah Bano case (reversal of the Supreme court judgement by an act of Parliament, after the Govt. decided to appease the communal section of Muslim leadership), and was followed by events like opening of the of locks of Babri Masjid, rath yatra, demolition of the Babri Masjid and the consequent anti-Muslim pogroms in Mumbai, Surat Bhopal and many other places), has been followed by the current anti Christian propaganda and accompanying attacks on them.\nThis decade of 80 has been the one in which the major target of the Sangh Parivar (SP) has been the Muslim community. From 98 to 2001 the ire of SP was gunned against the Christian populationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. The same phase of our polity has seen increasing incidences of violence against women, more so in the states ruled by the BJP govt. This period of our society has also seen massacre of Dalits and increase in the atrocities against them (Laxaman Pur Bathe, and Shankar Bigha massacre of Dalits: both by the Ranvir Sena, which has the tacit support of the Rich landlords and also has the political patronage of BJP. Also ten Dalits in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar, Mumbai, (where the BJP-Shiv Sena coalition rules) fell victim to the police bullets. This period has also witnessed the worst attacks on the rights of workers whose organized strength has been reduced to a miniscule and there has occurred a proliferation of the small sector, where working conditions are the worst possible. The social justice scene has also been the worst, and the post-Mandal aspirations have been &quot;successfully&quot; sidetracked to the margins, in the din of religion based campaigns.\nThese attacks are being conducted by different organizations like BJP, VHP, Bajrang Dal and many others like Hindu Jagaran Manch and Hindu Munnani, which are floated for the specific purpose of pursuing a particular agenda of the Hindutva politics. All these diverse and unconnected looking activities are coordinated by RSS, which is the CORE of Hindutva movement and the basic unit from where all the activists of this movement are trained and to which the members of Sangh Parivar owe their unflinching loyalty.\nPrior to this during last four -five decades one has witnessed the anti Muslim propaganda creating the ground for systematic violence against them. This propaganda was based on total fabrications. Similarly currently they are spreading the anti Christian venom by propagating that they indulge in forcible conversions, their educational institutions and hospitals are a mere ploy to convert the poor, Christianity is a foreign religion, they are anti-Nationals etc. These fabrications begin in the RSS shakha Bouddhik (intellectual sessions) and through various conveyor belts find their way to the common sense of society.\nBJP the political offspring of RSS has been in power in center, mainly in alliance with the other regional parties. This phase has witnessed many a changes, which are deeply at communalizing civic society. The Godhra episode followed by the anti Muslim pogrom in Gujarat has demonstrated the qualitative change in the nature of communal violence and the notions prevalent in section of population. The Gujarat carnage in a way has also woken up large section of concerned people to the dangers of communal politics.\n \n \n \nProfessor Ram Puniyani was Professor of Biomedical Engineering until 2004 when he retired. He now works full time for communal harmony. He is involved with human rights activities and has held a number of posts: Secretary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All India Secular Forum; Secretary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Center for Study of Society and Secularism; Secretary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ EKTA, Committee for Communal Amity. He is the recipient of a number of awards. He conducts numerous workshops and writes widely on communalism and related topics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f123fc9d99351c254328c2f37c0887c821e61938","amp;dn":"Fascism+of+sanghparivar+-+Must+Read+For+All+Indian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f123fc9d99351c254328c2f37c0887c821e61938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,35,252,157,153,53,28,37,67,40,194,243,124,8,135,200,33,230,25,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
