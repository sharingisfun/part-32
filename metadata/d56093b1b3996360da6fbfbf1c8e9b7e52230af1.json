The album is an ambitious project with the 137 songs recorded over the course of 1 1/2 years with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of twelve hours a day, seven days a week. Initially the project was inspired by Bill Wyman's &quot;Blues Odyssey&quot; and can be called an &quot;odyssey&quot; in its own right, for depicting a journey through the various epochs of Blues Music, starting at its African origins and finishing with modern-time Blues from the 60s and 70s. Subsequently the eleven CDs are titled the following: &quot;Beginnings&quot;, &quot;Country Blues&quot;, &quot;Louisiana &amp; New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Electric Memphis Blues&quot;, &quot;Texas Blues&quot;, &quot;Chicago Blues&quot;, &quot;Blues Ballads&quot;, &quot;Gospel Soul Blues &amp; Motown&quot;, &quot;Celtic &amp; Irish Blues&quot;, &quot;Latin Blues&quot; and &quot;60s &amp; 70s&quot;.\n\nThe collection is the fifth and last release in a line of Blues recordings Chris Rea has made since recovering from a serious disease at the turn of the millennium and promising himself a return to his Bluesy roots in the event that he survived. According to Rea &quot;Blue Guitars&quot; will be his last solo effort; however, he will continue to release albums as a member of the band &quot;Memphis Fireflies&quot;.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Guitars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Guitars&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56093b1b3996360da6fbfbf1c8e9b7e52230af1","amp;dn":"Chris+rea+Blue+Guitars+12+disc+11+cd+%2B+1+dvd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56093b1b3996360da6fbfbf1c8e9b7e52230af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,96,147,177,179,153,99,96,218,111,191,191,28,142,155,126,82,35,10,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
