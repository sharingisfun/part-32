The remainder of the issues from Captain America Vol. 5 and Winter Soldier Vol. 1 are in this part, as well as two other single issues - the 70th Anniversary Magazine special and the Siege: Captain America one-shot (which features both Rogers and Bucky as Cap). The final extra is X-Men and Steve Rogers: Escape From The Negative Zone TPB, which collects a story that ran in various specials (including Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier Annual). \n\n-Captain America v5 629-640 [by Cullen Bunn], which contains the sub folders:\n     01 Captain America &amp; Hawkeye (CA+H 629-632)\n     02 Captain America &amp; Iron Man (CA+IM 633-635)\n     03 Captain America &amp; Namor (CA+N 635.1)\n     04 Captain America &amp; Black Widow (CA+BW 636-640)\n-Winter Soldier 15-19 [by Jason Latour]\n-Captain America 70th Anniversary Magazine (2011) (C2C) (PeteThePIPster)\n-Siege - Captain America 01 (2010) (Digital) (Fawkes-Empire)\n-X-Men &amp; Steve Rogers - Escape From The Negative Zone (2012) (Digital TPB) (Nahga-Empire)\n\nThe issues of CA v5 are Digital from Nahga and Zone-Empire, except for #629 which is from Megan-Empire (not listed as digital; the actual digital copy from TheGroup is worse IMHO). The last few issues of Winter Solder are Digital from Fawkes-Empire and Minutemen-InnerDemons. The remaining cbr credits are listed in the title, obviously. Thanks to all the great scanner groups for their efforts, this is really excellent stuff! Hope you all enjoy this collection, take care and please seed. Thanks so much! :-)\n     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b0961e5deb0096be9bd1e31829ee80d58cfb023","amp;dn":"Captain+America+by+Brubaker+%282005-2013%7C100%25%7CD%2BS%7CMM%2BE%2BDCP%7C6%2F6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b0961e5deb0096be9bd1e31829ee80d58cfb023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,9,97,229,222,176,9,107,233,189,30,49,130,158,232,13,88,207,176,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
