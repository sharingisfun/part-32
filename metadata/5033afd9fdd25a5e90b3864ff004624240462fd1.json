Wheeden \nFormat: PDF \nHardcover: 532 pages \nPublisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 2 edition (April 24, 2015) \nLanguage: English \nISBN: 978-1498702898 \n\n\nNow considered a classic text on the topic, Measure and Integral: An Introduction to Real Analysis provides an introduction to real analysis by first developing the theory of measure and integration in the simple setting of Euclidean space, and then presenting a more general treatment based on abstract notions characterized by axioms and with less geometric content.\n\nPublished nearly forty years after the first edition, this long-awaited Second Edition also:\n\n- Studies the Fourier transform of functions in the spaces L1, L2, and Lp, 1 &lt; p &lt; 2\n- Shows the Hilbert transform to be a bounded operator on L2, as an application of the L2 theory of the Fourier transform in the one-dimensional case\n- Covers fractional integration and some topics related to mean oscillation properties of functions, such as the classes of HÃƒÂ¶lder continuous functions and the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation\n- Derives a subrepresentation formula, which in higher dimensions plays a role roughly similar to the one played by the fundamental theorem of calculus in one dimension\n- Extends the subrepresentation formula derived for smooth functions to functions with a weak gradient\n- Applies the norm estimates derived for fractional integral operators to obtain local and global first-order PoincarÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â€œSobolev inequalities, including endpoint cases\n- Proves the existence of a tangent plane to the graph of a Lipschitz function of several variables\n- Includes many new exercises not present in the first edition\n\nThis widely used and highly respected text for upper-division undergraduate and first-year graduate students of mathematics, statistics, probability, or engineering is revised for a new generation of students and instructors. The book also serves as a handy reference for professional mathematicians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5033afd9fdd25a5e90b3864ff004624240462fd1","amp;dn":"Measure+and+Integral%3A+An+Introduction+to+Real+Analysis%2C+2nd+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5033afd9fdd25a5e90b3864ff004624240462fd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,51,175,217,253,210,90,94,144,179,134,79,240,4,98,66,64,70,47,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
