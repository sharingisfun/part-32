In fact, I'd say he almost singe-handedly sparked the &quot;Bad Girls&quot; trend followed by some comic buyers &amp; publishers in the mid-1990s.\n\nThese are the recent high-quality digital releases from Tithe-Empire of the end of the 3-year William Messner-Loebs Wonder Woman run, on which Deodato got his big break. Deodato did not draw #86-89, but were included by Tithe. I did have to find an older digital release (from Zoom-Empire) of #0, and a lower-quality #1,000,000. \n\nAll credit to the scanners, and to shipjolly for posting these in one of his Hitlist Week torrents.\n\nThe reading order is #85-90, #0, and #91-100. The #1,000,000 issue is years later &amp; relatively unrelated to the rest. Comic Vine says that issue has a Deodato cover, and although it's uncredited, I agree.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Deodato later got into trouble by running an art studio and passing off his employees' art as his own. This was at a point (post-Wonder Woman) when his work was in high demand.\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nMike Deodato (born 23 May 1963 in Campina Grande, ParaÃƒÂ­ba, Brazil), sometimes credited as Mike Deodato Jr., is the professional pseudonym of Brazilian comic book artist Deodato Taumaturgo Borges Filho.\n\nOne of Deodato's first works was a 1993 photo-realistic comic book adaptation of the television series Beauty and the Beast published by Innovation Publishing. Deodato became famous in the North American comic book industry for his work with writer William Messner-Loebs on Wonder Woman. After his Wonder Woman project he had a short stint as the penciller of The Mighty Thor, where he worked with writer Warren Ellis, and later drew Glory for Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios at Image Comics and Maximum Press.\n\nWhile his style in the mid-90s was reminiscent of Jim Lee, he has recently changed to a more simplified, photo-realistic and sometimes moody style. His first work with this new artistic identity was The Incredible Hulk, written by Bruce Jones. Since then, he has worked on the Doctor Strange spin-off Witches and became the regular penciller of The Amazing Spider-Man and The New Avengers. Deodato then took over as regular penciller for the Marvel title Thunderbolts with issue 110, once again collaborating with Warren Ellis. Deodato then became the regular artist for the Dark Avengers ongoing series which came out of the conclusion of Secret Invasion. With writer Ed Brubaker, he launched the ongoing series Secret Avengers in 2010, before returning to New Avengers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52d5f6fbc3c730b9ed8c8139e55576e8d7341b81","amp;dn":"WONDER+WOMAN+by+Mike+Deodato+%28digital%29+%28Tithe-Empire%29+%28ZOOM-Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52d5f6fbc3c730b9ed8c8139e55576e8d7341b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,213,246,251,195,199,48,185,237,140,129,57,229,85,118,232,215,52,27,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
