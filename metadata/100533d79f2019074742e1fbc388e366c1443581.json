Later Sara is attacked by a dog and they recall that in the other side of the island there was a facility for training dogs that had been shutdown to avoid a rabies outbreak. While walking through the woods, they find a man called Luke, who sailed with his girlfriend Jenny to the island, covered of blood and Luke is killed by a pack of hounds. The group runs to the house and the animals put the place under siege, and they try to find a means of escape. When the survivors reach the compound, they disclose that the dogs have been genetically redesigned to become a breed of killers.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455362/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455362/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:100533d79f2019074742e1fbc388e366c1443581","amp;dn":"The+Breed+%282006%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"100533d79f2019074742e1fbc388e366c1443581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,5,51,215,159,32,25,7,71,66,225,251,195,136,227,102,193,68,53,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
