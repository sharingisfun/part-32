The job Disney did restoring this film is top notch, with great picture and sound. Each episode has an introduction by Walt Disney and there is also a short documentary about the film which chronicles its history. Please seed when your done downloading so others can enjoy a true Disney classic.\n\nOriginally airing in three parts on &quot;Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color,&quot; this thrilling adventure stars Patrick McGoohan as Dr. Syn, a kindly country vicar in 18th-century England.
