Bringing to searing life the terrifying intimacy of hand-to-hand infantry combat, this stunning war memoir features an indelibly drawn cast of characters, not all of whom would make it out of the city alive, as well as chilling accounts of Bellavia's singular courage: Entering one house alone, he used every weapon at his disposal in the fight of his life against America's most implacable enemy.\n\nAbout the Author: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bellavia&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bellavia&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/House-An-Epic-Memoir-War/dp/1416596607&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/House-An-Epic-Memoir-War/dp/1416596607&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02c89da0ee0a95bdc653bab6bb6bdfbb15f0d43","amp;dn":"House+to+House%3A+An+Epic+Memoir+of+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02c89da0ee0a95bdc653bab6bb6bdfbb15f0d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,44,137,218,14,224,169,91,220,101,59,171,107,182,189,251,177,95,13,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
