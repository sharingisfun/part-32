Included are two alternative versions of I Walk Alone. The others are Die Alive - the second single from My Winter Storm, and the earlier singles from the Finnish Christmas album Breath from Eternity: Happy New Year and You Would Have Loved This. The latter was sold only in Finland in a limited issue of 1000 copies. Enjoy this rare rip! Lossless of course. Also stay tuned for the new album. See Tarja touring this year!\n\nI have a final announcement to make. I've had lots of fun providing you with cool stuff. Sadly, I won't be around much longer. I have seeded all my torrents up to now, but in the times to come it will be up to you to keep my torrents alive. I hope you have enjoyed my many uploads during the past several months and will continue to do so. Also, support the authors (not IFPI/RIAA/MPAA/labels/studios - fuck those shits) and go see them live if possible.\n\nKopimi and enjoy life! Live long and prosper.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2110fd9b8971e0a4eed7ab8a558ad2a7249779","amp;dn":"Tarja+Turunen+-+5+singles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2110fd9b8971e0a4eed7ab8a558ad2a7249779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,33,16,253,155,137,113,224,164,238,215,171,138,85,138,210,167,36,151,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
