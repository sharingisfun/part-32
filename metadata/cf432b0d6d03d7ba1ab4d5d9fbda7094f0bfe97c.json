The lines, shadows and form of his exquisite architectural and cityscape work make for a perfect match with the sensual beauty of his Parisian models in his definitive photo montages. Raised in Paris by an artist engraver father and a poet mother, his openness to art, beauty and sexuality led him naturally to erotic photography by the time Dahmane was fifteen. Dreamy French sexuality combines with svelte dominatrices and nymph-like subs in his manufactured dreamscapes. The nude is simultaneously the focal point of desire and a surreal symbol. His first erotic book was published with Taschen, simply entitled Dahmane, followed by the more extreme Porn Art series in 1996 and 1998. In 2005, two portfolios of his photomontages in a limited edition are released, entitled Nude Addict 1 &amp; 2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf432b0d6d03d7ba1ab4d5d9fbda7094f0bfe97c","amp;dn":"Dahmane+%28B%2BW+Photography+Art%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf432b0d6d03d7ba1ab4d5d9fbda7094f0bfe97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,67,43,13,109,3,215,186,26,180,213,217,251,218,112,148,240,191,233,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
