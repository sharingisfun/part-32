After a detailed introduction to general state space models, this book focuses on dynamic linear models, emphasizing their Bayesian analysis. Whenever possible it is shown how to compute estimates and forecasts in closed form; for more complex models, simulation techniques are used. A final chapter covers modern sequential Monte Carlo algorithms.\n\nThe book illustrates all the fundamental steps needed to use dynamic linear models in practice, using R. Many detailed examples based on real data sets are provided to show how to set up a specific model, estimate its parameters, and use it for forecasting. All the code used in the book is available online.\n\nNo prior knowledge of Bayesian statistics or time series analysis is required, although familiarity with basic statistics and R is assumed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f21190262f060ad7cd97141fc12218d7d3752801","amp;dn":"Dynamic+Linear+Models+with+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f21190262f060ad7cd97141fc12218d7d3752801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,17,144,38,47,6,10,215,205,151,20,31,193,34,24,215,211,117,40,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
