Mild-mannered, goodhearted Minato is a ronin: despite his intelligence, he's failed the exam to get into the university of his choice--twice. He's also an &quot;Ashikabi,&quot; a human who shares supernatural bonds with the Sekirei, extraterrestrial beings who take the form of human females with phenomenal powers (not the least of which is keeping their pneumatic figures inside their scanty costumes). All the Sekirei are pitted against each other in a deadly game orchestrated by the evil president of the all-powerful MBI Corporation, but the six who live with Minato in Maison Izumo spend the first several episodes squabbling over who's his favorite. Episode seven presents a lot of background information from season one, but by that time, viewers will have given up on the tangled but fragmentary plot. The filmmakers try to raise the stakes in the later episodes, but the characters are so shallow and silly that the attempts to convey serious emotions come across as bathos. Sekirei: Pure Engagement plays like Love, Hina restaged by Victoria's Secret. It's an inane succession of jiggle shots and fights designed to excite hormonal adolescent boys. The OVA &quot;Two Gossip Topics&quot; acts as a sort of bridge between the seasons, and features even more nudity and boob jokes. (Rated TV MA: risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© humor, extensive nudity, violence, violence against women, suggested lesbianism, alcohol and tobacco use) --Charles Solomon \n(1. Silent Omen, 2. The Wind Blows, 3.
