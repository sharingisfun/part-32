If you were able to download any of these albums earlier this month, and have some free bandwidth to spare today, I'd appreciate the seeding help.  If you're unsure how, simply (1) create a folder called &quot;2014 - The Year In Christian Music (Bundle 52)&quot; in the same folder where your torrents are usually downloaded to.  (2) copy and paste your downloaded music into that folder.  (3) then download the torrent as you normally would.  Your torrent client will recognize that you already have some of these albums, and instead of a downloader, you will be recognized as an uploader for those albums you just copied over.\n\nFollowing this torrent today, I still have 92 additional 2014 titles to share from the previous month.  Hopefully I'll be able to get to those in short order.  In the mean while, I continue to work towards creating a new torrent with fresh music which I also hope to share with everyone soon.\n\nThere are 34 titles being offered in today's bundle, including...\n\n * Dave And Jess Ray - 2014 - The Doorpost Songs - This Is Love\n * David And The Giants - 2014 - Still Rockin\n * David Daughtry - 2014 - David Daughtry\n * David Keigh - 2014 - Something Different EP\n * Deezy Yates - 2014 - Another Day's Work EP\n * Deitrick Haddon - 2014 - Best Of\n * Disciple - 2014 - Attack\n * Disciple - 2014 - Unbroken - Single\n * Dubj - 2014 - Ten\n * Eamonn McCrystal - 2014 - A Living Prayer\n * Earnest Pugh - 2014 - Just Worship\n * Elevate Worship - 2014 - I Believe - New Testament\n * Epic Music - 2014 - God Of Shining Light EP\n * Everfound - 2014 - Reimagine EP\n * Everfound - 2014 - Take This City - Single\n * Farewell Flight - 2014 - Lonesome Traveler\n * Fit For A King - 2014 - A Greater Sense Of Self - Single\n * Flyleaf - 2014 - Marionette - Single\n * Fred Hammond - 2014 - I Will Trust - Single\n * Garris - 2014 - Steadfast Lamentations\n * Gateway Worship - 2014 - Gloria A Dios\n * Gladys Knight - 2014 - Where My Heart Belongs\n * GMG - 2014 - More Than Music\n * GODsDisciple - 2014 - No Compromise\n * Hardie Avenue - 2014 - Can't Live Like This - Single\n * Heritage - 2014 - Heart For The House\n * Hood - 2014 - The Difference Between Movies And Films\n * Hotel Books - 2014 - I'm Almost Happy Here\n * Housefires - 2014 - Housefires II\n * Iam Justified - 2014 - Revolution\n * James Brooks - 2014 - The Whole - Single\n * James Hand - 2014 - Stormclouds In Heaven\n * James Harv - 2014 - Hope Music\n * Jason Malachi - 2014 - Come Home\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts, September 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c527ebf72f48b0340524225b7605ee92375bf54","amp;dn":"2014+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+52%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c527ebf72f48b0340524225b7605ee92375bf54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,82,126,191,114,244,139,3,64,82,66,37,183,96,94,233,35,117,191,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
