It was released for the Xbox on July 15, 2003, for Microsoft Windows on November 19, 2003, and on September 7, 2004 for Mac OS X. The Xbox version is playable on Xbox 360 with its Backward Compatibility feature.[1] The PC version was re-released as part of the Star Wars: The Best of PC collection in 2006 as a limited release. The sequel, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian Entertainment at BioWare's suggestion[2] as BioWare wanted to focus on their own intellectual properties. Jeremy Soule wrote the soundtrack score for the game\n\nThis game's system is based on Wizards of the Coast's Star Wars Roleplaying Game, which is based on the d20 role-playing game system derived from the Third Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules. Combat is round-based; time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack and react simultaneously. However, the number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While each round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time, the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round.\n\nThe alignment system tracks actions and speechÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from simple word choices to major plot decisionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to determine whether the player's character aligns with the light or dark side of the Force. Generosity and altruism lead to the light side, while selfish or violent actions will lead the player's character to the dark side, which will alter the character's appearance, turning their eyes yellow and their skin pale.\n\nNon-combat interaction with other characters in the game world is based upon a dialogue menu system. Following each statement, the player can select from a list of menu responses. The dialogue varies based on the gender and skills of the main character.\n\nMinimum System Requirements\nMicrosoft Windows:\nPentium III or Athlon 1 GHz CPU, 256 MB RAM, 32 MB OpenGL 1.4 &amp; hardware T&amp;L compliant AGP or PCI graphics card, DirectX 9.0c compliant audio device, 4X Speed CD-ROM drive, Microsoft Windows 98SE/ME/2000/XP, DirectX 9.0c","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2c85504279f6383a54dd1b0bc03c6b4a20ebf2","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Knights+Of+The+Old+Republic+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2c85504279f6383a54dd1b0bc03c6b4a20ebf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,44,133,80,66,121,246,56,58,84,221,27,11,192,60,107,74,32,235,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
