Since the end of WWII, conventional wisdom claimed that Imperial Japan was years away from building an atomic weapon--this special shatters this view. Using once secret Japanese wartime documents, we provide evidence that Japan had world- class nuclear physicists, access to uranium ore, and cyclotrons to process it. They devised an innovative way to deliver the bombs using 400-foot long Sen Toku submarines, capable of carrying and launching airplanes. Most startling--just six days after Hiroshima, Japan tested its own atomic device on a small island 20 miles off the Korean coast. The sobering conclusion is that Japan may have been just weeks behind the US in the race for the bomb.\n\n\n   * Evidence suggests Japan was just weeks behind the U.S. in the race to build the bomb.\n    * Formerly top-secret Japanese documents help tell the dramatic tale.\n    * See how the Japanese planned to deliver the deadly device.\n\nSince the end of WWII, conventional wisdom claimed that Imperial Japan was years away from building an atomic weapon.
