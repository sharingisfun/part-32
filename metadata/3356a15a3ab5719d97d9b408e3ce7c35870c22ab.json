They are a Grindcore band.\n\nColumns play Grind thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s groovy and passionate. This is the kind of music that ignites pits and gets even reluctant Metalheads to start moving. Even when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing at top speed and blast beats are flying everywhere the band have a definite swagger and rhythm to their grinding destruction.\nType:\n    EP\nRelease date:\n    March 28th, 2013\nCatalog ID:\n    N/A\n\nLabel:\n    Independent\nFormat:\n    Unknown\n\n\n    Songs\n    Lineup\n    Reviews\n    Additional notes\n\n1. \tDrifter Aftermath \t01:31 \t  Show lyrics\n2. \tThe God Clause \t02:15 \t  Show lyrics\n3. \tBottom Feeders \t01:39 \t  Show lyrics\n4. \tNo One's Fucking Waiting \t02:31 \t  Show lyrics\n  \t07:56 \t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3356a15a3ab5719d97d9b408e3ce7c35870c22ab","amp;dn":"Columns+-+Please+Explode++mp3++320k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3356a15a3ab5719d97d9b408e3ce7c35870c22ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,86,161,90,58,181,113,157,151,217,180,8,227,206,124,53,135,12,34,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
