As a teenager, he became obsessed with martial arts and with a religious fervour began studying karate to protect himself. After winning a tournament, he travelled to Japan, where he trained for three years under one of the country's foremost martial arts experts.\n\nWhen he returned home in 1974, Pitera was a very different man. Quiet and introspective, sullen and aloof, he had developed his body into a fighting machine. He began associating with gangsters from the Bonanno family and was soon dealing drugs on a huge scale, while simultaneously embarking on a killing spree that spanned almost two decades.\n\nIn 1992, Pitera was sentenced to life in prison for murdering six people and supporting a massive drug-dealing operation, yet this covered only a fraction of the crimes he committed. Pitera is thought to have murdered more than 60 people, cutting many of his victims into pieces before burying them on Staten Island.\n\nExhaustively researched and written with the cooperation of the DEA agents who hunted Pitera down, The Butcher is the perfect good-versus-evil story and will send shivers down the spine of even the most hardened true-crime reader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f11514008e56a01231f3d3cdb903016ec3300f","amp;dn":"Philip+Carlo+-+The+Butcher+%28mobi+%2B+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f11514008e56a01231f3d3cdb903016ec3300f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,241,21,20,0,142,86,160,18,49,243,211,205,185,3,1,110,195,48,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
