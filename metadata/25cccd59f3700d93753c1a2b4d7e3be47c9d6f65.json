Presumably inspired by the musical of the same name, Nugent once also explained that he coined the name because whenever someone asked him how he and Tommy Shaw would sound playing together, he would always reply by saying they would sound like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa bunch of damn Yankees.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nProduced by rock producer Ron Nevison, the new bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-titled debut album went double-platinum in 1990. Ted Nugent's well-tooled heavy blues guitar became a cornerstone, but Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw rose to the forefront as a potent vocal duo. Jack BladesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading single &quot;Coming of Age,&quot; hit #64 on the U.S. Top 40, and #1 on the AOR charts, while Tommy ShawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Come Again&quot; received extensive AOR airplay.\n\nIn 1992, Damn Yankees once again went platinum with their follow-up album DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Tread. The title song (sung by Jack Blades) enjoyed extensive coverage at the Barcelona Olympic Games. Ted Nugent also appeared on Rock the Vote, voicing support for the GOP against Bill Clinton. Although the second release was not as successful as the first album, it contained a few minor hits, such as &quot;Mister Please,&quot; &quot;Where You GoinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Now,&quot; and &quot;The Silence Is Broken,&quot; a Top-10 AOR power ballad featured on the 1993 Jean-Claude Van Damme film Nowhere to Run.\n\nDon't Tread is the second and last studio album released by Rock supergroup Damn Yankees.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25cccd59f3700d93753c1a2b4d7e3be47c9d6f65","amp;dn":"Damn+Yankees+-+Don%5C%27t+Tread+On+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25cccd59f3700d93753c1a2b4d7e3be47c9d6f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,204,205,89,243,112,13,147,117,60,26,43,77,126,59,228,124,157,111,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
