At times sombre, at times satirical, Tolstoy's novel raises questions about the way we live and how we should strive even at the end to seek final redemption. It is a powerful masterpiece of psychological exploration, and has influenced writers as diverse as Hemingway and Nabokov.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0668ce0ddfb547c3e96f35fc13d2c2b8a574b2df","amp;dn":"Leo+Tolstoy+-+The+Death+of+Ivan+Ilych+%5BNaxos%5D+96+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0668ce0ddfb547c3e96f35fc13d2c2b8a574b2df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,104,206,13,223,181,71,195,233,111,53,252,19,210,194,184,165,116,178,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
