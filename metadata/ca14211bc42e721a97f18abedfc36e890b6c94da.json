Famed as a gunslinger, feared for his lethal speed and accuracy, Falcon decides to make it a fair fight when he comes upon a man being attacked by a bandit gang in the Dakota Territory. The man is Teddy Roosevelt, the Rough Rider, himself. Roosevelt knows a brave man when he sees one. And he calls on Falcon when a judge's daughter is taken by an outlaw trying to pry his brother free. With no trust in-or from-the law, Falcon has only one way to do this job: alone and ready to kill. But the outlaws know he's coming, the woman he's trying to rescue knows some tricks of her own, and winning a bloody battle in the Dakotas will take more than courage-it will take a man's will to live like a legend...or die like one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca14211bc42e721a97f18abedfc36e890b6c94da","amp;dn":"William+Johnstone+-Eagles+09+Destiny+of+Eagles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca14211bc42e721a97f18abedfc36e890b6c94da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,20,33,27,196,46,114,26,151,241,138,190,223,195,110,137,11,108,148,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
