The first song I heard was the first track of the album -- Destination Diamonds.\n\nI finally just purchased this album, and I&amp;#039;m so excited to share it.  \n\nPopsicle was released in 2005, and I&amp;#039;ve been actively tracking Diamond Nights on the net, but they don&amp;#039;t seem to have any activity since a bout a year and a half ago. Does anyone know what happened to them? \n\nI would love to see this band live.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:514588a8ebb02f140ac41261c7bca4064279859b","amp;dn":"Diamond+Nights-Popsicle+%28Explicit+Version%29+%282005%29%5BMP3+192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"514588a8ebb02f140ac41261c7bca4064279859b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,69,136,168,235,176,47,20,10,196,18,97,199,188,164,6,66,121,133,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
