WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re 40,000 years overdue.\n\nA LAND OF ASH\n\nLava flows stretch for hundreds of miles. A cloud of ash billows east, burying the Midwest, destroying crops, and falling upon the Atlantic Coast like a warm, dead snow. The remnants of the United States flees south as the global temperatures plummet.\n\nAmid this total devastation are stories of families, friends, sons and fathers and wives: the survivors. Within are eleven stories focusing on the human element of such a catastrophe, from an elderly couple gathering to await their death to a father sealing his shelter in hopes of keeping the air breathable for his daughter. Contributing to this collection include many popular and up-and-coming independent authors, including David McAfee, Daniel Arenson, and more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b449e6f86b1d3c59721eae2d8d6b1bd5b8d9c8e4","amp;dn":"Land+of+ash+-+David+McAfee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b449e6f86b1d3c59721eae2d8d6b1bd5b8d9c8e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,73,230,248,107,29,60,89,114,30,174,45,141,107,27,213,184,217,200,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
