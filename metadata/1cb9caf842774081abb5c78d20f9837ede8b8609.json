The friendship\n          that we earn keeps us continuing every single day of the year\n          and it will go on like this. So we wanna say thank you to all the\n         ppl that helped us over the last 2 years ... siteops, groups and\n        any kind of sceners. In the  times of  flaming and  arrogance its a\n       luck to find ppl with the same attitude like we have. We  appreciate\n         your help and your support in any way. So if  you wanna  join our\n               small  and welfare community, dont hesitate\n                 to contact us.\n\nWe dont care for a monthly amount of rips\nits still all about the music and friendship.\n\nLast but not least a few greets fly\n\nto our friends from :\n\n1way AMOK BCC BFHMP3 BOSS CMC CMG DPS EMP FKK FuFFENS gEm HiT2000 iTS kiNKy\n\nkW mbs miso MPX MYCEL PsyCZ sb sour SSR TR UBE UKi\n\nTHE END !\n\n.K!ND.\n\n.Drum 2005","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cb9caf842774081abb5c78d20f9837ede8b8609","amp;dn":"VA_-_25_Years_Of_Palazzo_%28Mixed_By_Eric_Sneo%29-%28ZYX82771-2-2CD%29-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cb9caf842774081abb5c78d20f9837ede8b8609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,185,202,248,66,119,64,129,171,181,199,141,32,249,131,126,222,139,134,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
