There are many fundamental changes in this release, compared to previous releases of CentOS. Notably the inclusion of systemd, Gnome3, and a default filesystem of XFS. For more information about what makes CentOS 7 stand out, please see our release notes.\nWith the release of CentOS 7, the board will be able to focus on getting the Community Builders online, and facilitating the progress for the several Special Interest Groups that have been on hold during the release cycle.\nGroups such as OpenStack, Xen4, Gluster, and oVirt can now customize CentOS Linux directly inside the project, building CentOS variants for new workloads on top of the slow-and-steady core platform.\t\n\nNOTE: THIS IS TOO LARGE FOR A DVD.
