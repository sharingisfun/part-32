It \n\n\nincludes work with YES; KING CRIMSON; GENESIS; numerous like-minded musicians. \n\n\nBruford kept breaking new ground. His body of work is reminiscent of jazzmen who\n\n\nwere able to record with many different musicians, as seen fit by their musical\n\n\ncreativity - unemcumbered by stifling record contracts.  Last I heard he's\n\n\n&quot;retired&quot;....wishing to make room for young talent.  Now that's a classy way to \n\n\nsay goodbye!\n\n\nEAC/WAV  FLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c0985f3c321b36d3123d7953d87f004169527e6","amp;dn":"Bill+Bruford%3A+Master+Strokes++1978-85","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c0985f3c321b36d3123d7953d87f004169527e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,9,133,243,195,33,179,109,49,35,215,149,61,135,240,4,22,149,39,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
