The band \nachieved success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when it was often associated with the \nburgeoning New Romantic fashion movement (though the band itself has downplayed any such \nconnection) They achieved several UK hits in the early 1980s, most notably &quot;Ghosts&quot; and \n&quot;I Second That Emotion&quot; which were top ten hits in 1982.\n\nThe band began as a group of friends. Brothers David Sylvian (guitar and vocals) and \nSteve Jansen (drums) keyboardist Richard Barbieri and bassist Mick Karn studied at the same \nschool. Guitarist Rob Dean joined later, but before the band had its hits. As youngsters they \nplayed Sylvian's two-chord numbers mainly as a means of escape; sometimes with Karn as the \nfront man, sometimes with Sylvian at the fore.\n\nThey dubbed themselves Japan in 1974, signed a recording contract with German disco label Hansa\nand became an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of David Bowie, T.Rex, and The New York \nDolls.\n\nAdolescent Sex\n\n   1.
