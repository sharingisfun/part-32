Intended for undergraduate students in a variety of majors, this text presents the application of molecular symmetry on optical spectra (ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and Raman) through group theory, and uses numerous examples to illustrate practical theory applications.\r\n\r\nRecognize the Symmetry of Any Atomic Arrangement and the Point Group to Which It Belongs\r\n\r\nDivided into five chapters, this book is designed to help students choose a method or several methods for material characterization, measure a correct spectrum, and interpret the spectrum or correlate the spectra obtained using different methods. It includes solid-state active media for lasers, as well as coordination and organometallic complexes, minerals, and metal ions in biological systems, and also provides 3D representations.\r\n\r\nThis book addresses:\r\n\r\nClassifying molecules according to their symmetry\r\nWhat happens when an ion of transition metal enters an environment with a given symmetry\r\nHow atomic orbitals are involved in molecular bonding\r\nWhether the molecule is a rigid construction or a dynamic structure (which can either interact with light or not at all)\r\nHow to perform a reliable spectrum measurement\r\n\r\nCondensed Matter Optical Spectroscopy: An Illustrated Introduction does not require any prior knowledge on group theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43de7da1bae2adf61664ed2bb8e9a7764902c573","amp;dn":"Condensed+Matter+Optical+Spectroscopy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43de7da1bae2adf61664ed2bb8e9a7764902c573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,222,125,161,186,226,173,246,22,100,237,43,184,233,167,118,73,2,197,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
