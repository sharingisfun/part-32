The board chairman announces that the rest of the meeting will be closed, due to personnel issues. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IssuesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is correct. The proposal up for a vote before them is whether to authorize the killing of a local reporter. The vote is four to one in favor.\n\nMeanwhile, not far away, Virgil Flowers is helping out a friend by looking into a dognapping, which seems to be turning into something much bigger and uglierÃ¢â‚¬â€a team of dognappers supplying medical labsÃ¢â‚¬â€when he gets a call from Lucas Davenport. A murdered body has been foundÃ¢â‚¬â€and the victim is a local reporter. . . .\n\nSeries: A Virgil Flowers Novel (Book 8)\nPublisher: Putnam Adult; First Edition edition (October 7, 2014)\nLanguage: English\n\nEnjoy!\n\n Praise for Deadline\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Another brainy thriller from a prolific author, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDeadlineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fulfills readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ expectations of SandfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiction: tense, smart and character-driven.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Richmond Times Dispatch\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Rich characters [and] the descriptions of small-town life, politics and corruption and the concurrent trails of action make for a fast and entertaining read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sandford's best Flowers book to date. . . . There is a lot of drama and mayhem in this story and readers of traditional Sandford books will be satisfied for sure. Still if you like a little humor in your plots, this book will more than sate that desire. This book is the most fun I have had reading in a long time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Huffington Post\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot going on in Deadline . . . The biggest joys of this series are Flowers himself (his boss is Lucas Davenport from the Sandford's Prey novels), the cast of eccentric supporting characters and the humorous dialogue.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Shelf Awareness\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sandford keeps one last surprise up his sleeve for the denouement of the dognapping case, and it's a doozy. Exhilaratingly professional work by both Virgil and his creator that breaks no new ground but will keep the fans happy and add to their number.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Stellar . . . Sandford is an accomplished and amusing storyteller, and he nails both the rural characters and terrain as well as he has skewered urban life in past installments.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sanford balances straight-talking Virgil FlowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ often hilariously folksy tone and TripptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark core of methamphetamine manufacturers and sociopaths; the result is pure reading pleasure for thriller fans.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist\n\nPraise for Storm Front\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“John Sandford has the Midas touch. [Storm Front is] exciting, complex and funny all the way through. Virgil is a unique character [and] the beauty of SandfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing is that the narrative of the book is told in perfect harmony with FlowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personality . . . Entertaining reading all the way.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€The Huffington Post","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9496fc6bd45d38a1f33e45dc51f875efe125c67","amp;dn":"Deadline+-+John+Sandford+PDF+EPUB+%2B+COVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9496fc6bd45d38a1f33e45dc51f875efe125c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,73,111,198,189,69,211,138,31,51,228,93,197,31,135,94,254,18,92,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
