There, in the company of a torture survivor, a lame dog, and other unforgettable characters, Maya Vidal writes her story, which includes pursuit by a gang of assassins, the police, the FBI, and Interpol. In the process, she unveils a terrible family secret, comes to understand the meaning of love and loyalty, and initiates the greatest adventure of her life: the journey into her own soul.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a00c1d04cafe41c607f05a8bc8aa1cb577c72f","amp;dn":"+Isabel+Allende+-+Maya%27s+Notebook+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a00c1d04cafe41c607f05a8bc8aa1cb577c72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,160,12,29,4,202,254,65,198,7,240,90,139,200,170,28,181,119,199,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
