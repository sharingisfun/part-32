Some of the Burnett/Dixon recordings were later released on the &quot;Run Now&quot; vinyl EP. Those tracks, plus a few more outtakes, were then included on the 1998 CD reissue of &quot;Songs From The Film.&quot;\n\nThese five tunes are recordings from the original sessions that remain unreleased. Four of them were re-recorded for the second version of the album, but none of these particular recordings appear on any officially released version of &quot;Songs From The Film.&quot; I believe these are unfinished mixes, as I've heard more polished versions of some of these songs.\n\nFrom a cassette received in trade in 1984.\n\ncassette (azimuth adjusted)&gt;CD-R&gt;EAC&gt;Audacity (amplify)&gt;CD Wave&gt;Flac\n\nExcellent sound quality. Check the samples below. (The slight boost in volume at the beginning of &quot;Call On Me&quot; is on my original tape.)\n\nUploaded to dime by punchomatic, June 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eb53c333258dc167610ecbd4ceb282aebaf48f1","amp;dn":"Tommy+Keene+1984+Reflection+Studios%2C+Charlotte%2C+NC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eb53c333258dc167610ecbd4ceb282aebaf48f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,181,60,51,50,88,220,22,118,16,236,189,76,235,40,42,235,175,72,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
