For each primary class of processes, such as forging, rolling, extrusion, wiredrawing, and sheet-metal forming, it explains how FEA (Finite Elements Analysis) can be applied with great precision to characterize the forming condition and in this way optimize the processes. FEA has made it possible to build very realistic FEM-models of any metal forming process, including complex three-dimensional forming operations, in which complex products are shaped by complex dies. Thus, using FEA it is now possible to visualize any metal forming process and to study strain, stresses, and other forming conditions inside the parts being manufactured as they develop throughout the process.\nBook Description\nThis book outlines metal forming theory and how experimental methods are utilized to understand how metal forming works. For each main process, such as forging, rolling, extrusion, wiredrawing, and sheet-metal forming, it demonstrates how FEA (Finite Elements Analysis) can accurately characterize the forming condition and therefore optimize the processes.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 476 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (March 31, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521518237\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521518239","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f3e50428875cd026525adfbfc62c3d36ce0cad","amp;dn":"Applied+Metal+Forming+-+Including+FEM+Analysis%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1f3e50428875cd026525adfbfc62c3d36ce0cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,243,229,4,40,135,92,208,38,82,90,223,191,198,44,61,54,206,12,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
