Formerly members of Bikini Atoll I saw this duo supporting Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds late last year and was very impressed. Joe plays guitar and sings and the shark plays literally everything else and manages to pull off crazy shapes at the same time.  A hard style to describe precisely this is a dark ironic bluesy but quintesentially english take on alt rock that's not quite like anything you've heard before.\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce44e04ea6b50a3799202bcb485abfced544caa0","amp;dn":"Joe+Gideon+and+the+Shark+-+Harum+Scarum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce44e04ea6b50a3799202bcb485abfced544caa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,68,224,78,166,181,10,55,153,32,43,203,72,90,191,206,213,68,202,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
