In place of the bluesy focus on his first two albums, Winter extended himself into more of a rock-oriented mode here, in both his singing and his selection of material. This was hard rock with a blues edge, and had a certain commercial smoothness lacking in his earlier work. Derringer\\'s presence on guitar and as a songwriter saw to it that Winter\\'s blues virtuosity was balanced by perfectly placed guitar hooks, and the two guitarists complemented each other perfectly throughout as well. There wasn\\'t a weak moment anywhere on the record, and if Johnny Winter And wasn\\'t a huge commercial success, it was mostly because of the huge amount of competition at the time from other, equally inspired players, that kept numbers like the Winter originals \\&quot;Prodigal Son\\&quot; and \\&quot;Guess I\\'ll Go Away\\&quot; as well as Derringer co-authored pieces such as \\&quot;Look Up\\&quot; from having the impact they should have had on FM radio.\n\nTracklist\n\n1.Made In the Shade  2:31 \n2.They Call Me Lazy 2:56 \n3.Family Rules 1:45 \n4.Ooh Pooh Pah Do 4:01 \n5.Drivin\\' Wheel 4:16 \n6.Allons Dancez  3:05 7\n7.Struggle In Houston 2:35 \n8.You\\'re Humbuggin\\' Me 2:11 \n9.Just a Little Bit 2:02 \n10.Rainin\\' Breakdown 2:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6a10e30d54221199117bc3f2da16a04b3261ec","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter%28with+Uncle+John+Turner%29+Winter+and+Turner%28rock%2Cblu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6a10e30d54221199117bc3f2da16a04b3261ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,106,16,227,13,84,34,17,153,17,123,195,242,218,22,160,75,50,97,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
