This casebook contains materials relevant to a deeper understanding of the origins and reception of this controversial text, including Conrad's own story &quot;An Outpost of Progress,&quot; together with a little-known memoir by one of Conrad's oldest English friends, a brief history of the Congo Free State by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and a parody of Conrad by Max Beerbohm. A wide range of theoretical approaches are also represented, examining Conrad's text in terms of cultural, historical, textual, stylistic, narratological, post-colonial, feminist, and reader-response criticism. The volume concludes with an interview in which Conrad compares his adventures on the Congo with Mark Twain's experiences as a Mississippi pilot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38871fafe13ffe3f504cb694ab309b93c0009651","amp;dn":"Joseph+Conrad%5C%27s+Heart+of+Darkness%3A+A+Casebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38871fafe13ffe3f504cb694ab309b93c0009651","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,135,31,175,225,63,254,63,80,76,182,148,171,48,155,147,192,0,150,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
