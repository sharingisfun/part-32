Rather good I think. They also have a web site (http://www.shopnotes.com/)\nand sell woodworking plans online at their online plans store (http://www.plansnow.com/).\n\n##################################\n\nI had shared some of this before, but it was my first time and I wanted to improve it somewhat. Also some issues were of mediocre quality. \n\nThis collection is WAY BETTER! All issues are of excellent quality bar 81, 82 &amp; 83; but they are usable. There are a lot of extras with this collection - check out parts 11, 12, 13 &amp; 14.\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget, you can use uTorrent (or such) to selectively download parts of each torrent. Also, why not check out the files where you got the torrent?\n\nIncluded with each is a file called &amp;#039;ShopNotes Collection (Final) - File Listing.chm&amp;#039; and this file too.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nHeres what was/is there:\n\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 81 - 86 - Mixed Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes #1 - #82 (An index &amp; synopsis with misc files) AND iss\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 61 - 70 - Very Good Quality (missing #64)\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 71 - 80 - Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 31 - 40 - Very Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 41 - 50 - Very Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 51 - 60 - Very Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 21 - 30 - Very Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 21 - 30 - Very Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 11 - 20 - Very Good Quality\nOther &gt; E-books\tShopnotes issues 1 - 10 - Very Good Quality\n\n##################################\n\nGrab the &amp;#039;File Listing&amp;#039; for this collection.\n\nAnyway, hope you like it. Ah, could someone please seed this after a while? Thanks. Moving hse in about 2 weeks, gonna lose bb connection.\n\nPS. Apologies to previous downloaders, but I&amp;#039;m just getting the hang of sharing torrents. For you ppl, the main changes are parts 11 - 14 (added) and I was pretty clear about file quality before - just selectively download the updated files.\n\nCheers. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ba6024651f8eb6c1c7c372c16bdf1c6762a87c5","amp;dn":"ShopNotes+Collection+%28Final%29+-+%5BPART+14+of+14%5D+-+A+few+Nice+Extr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ba6024651f8eb6c1c7c372c16bdf1c6762a87c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,166,2,70,81,248,235,108,28,124,55,44,22,189,241,198,118,42,135,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
