During the development, many file formats have been added.\n\nMilkShape 3D has all basic operations like select, move, rotate, scale, extrude, turn edge, subdivide, just to mention a few. MilkShape 3D also allows low-level editing with the vertex and face tool. Primitives like spheres, boxes and cylinders are also available.\n\nMilkShape 3D has also skeletal animation capabilities. This allows to export to morph target animation like the ones in the Quake model formats or to export to skeletal animations like Half-Life or Genesis3d.\n\nMilkShape 3D currently supports 37 different file formats from 27 different games/ engines/programs.\n\nDownload MilkShape 3D yourself and see how easy it is to create models!\n\n \nFile Format Support\nFormat\tImport\tExport\t3rd party\nHalf-Life SMD\tYes\tYes\t \nHalf-Life MDL\tDecompile Only\tYes (Compile)\t \nQuake MDL\t \tYes (Compile)\t \nQuake II MD2\tYes\tYes\t \nQuake III: Arena MD3\tYes\tYes\t \nUnreal/UT Engine 3D\tYes\tYes\t \nUnreal/UT Engine Skeletal Mesh PSK\tYes\tYes\t \nVampire: the Masquerade NOD\tYes\tYes\t \nGenesis3D 1.0 BDY\tYes\tYes\t \nGenesis3D 1.0 MOT\tYes\tYes\t \nGenesis3D 1.0 ACT\tDecompile Only\t \t \nSerious Sam MDL\tYes\t \t \nSerious Sam LWO/SCR\t \tYes\t \nMax Payne KF2\tYes\tYes\t \nMax Payne KFS\tYes\tYes\t \nMax Payne SKD\tYes\tYes\t \nThe Sims SKN\tYes\tYes\t \nWavefront OBJ\tYes\tYes\t \n3D Studio ASC\tYes\tYes\t \nLightWave LOW\tYes\tYes\t \nLightWave 6.5x LOW\t \tYes\t \nAutoCAD DXF\tYes\tYes\t \nPOV-Ray INC\t \tYes\t \nVRML1 WRL\t \tYes\t \nVRML97 WRL\t \tYes\tYes\nAutodesk 3DS\tYes\tYes\t \nRAW Triangles\tYes\tYes\t \nRenderMan RIB\t \tYes\t \nLithtech ABC v11, v12 (NOLF)\tYes\tYes\t \nLithium UnWrapper\tYes\t \t \nPlaystation TMD\tYes\t \tYes\nBioVision Motion Capture BVH\tYes\t \tYes\nNebula Script\t \tYes\tYes\nJedi Knight 3DO\t \tYes\tYes\nGenEdit 3DT\t \tYes\tYes\nDirectX 8.0\t \tYes\tYes\nDirectX 8.0 (JT)\t \tYes\tYes\n/**************************************************/\n\nurl: http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2366777297e16a829527fca73280042ed539ee3","amp;dn":"Milkshape+3d+1.7.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2366777297e16a829527fca73280042ed539ee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,54,103,119,41,126,22,168,41,82,127,202,115,40,0,66,237,83,158,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
