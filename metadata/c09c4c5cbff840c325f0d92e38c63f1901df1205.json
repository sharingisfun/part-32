This newest edition to the Laboratory Techniques Series gives current state of the art use of synthetic peptides in molecular biology and practical protocols on how to conjugate peptides, immunize animals with peptides and monitor immune responses to peptides in vitro. It gives background information on antigenic specificity, prediction of antigenic sites in proteins and applications of peptides in immunology and virology, as probes in diagnosis and as vaccines. The book also describes antigenicity of proteins and methods to localize antigenic sites as well as methods for predicting epitoxes, and gives detailed protocols for peptide-carrier conjugation, immunization with peptides, and peptide immunoassays. The volume also describes typical use of antipeptide antibodies in molecular and cellular biology as well as the use of peptides in the diagnosis of viral infections and autoimmune diseases, and the use of peptides as potential synthe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09c4c5cbff840c325f0d92e38c63f1901df1205","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1999%5D+Laboratory+Techniques+in+Biochemistry+and+Molecular","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09c4c5cbff840c325f0d92e38c63f1901df1205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,156,76,92,191,248,64,195,37,240,217,46,56,198,63,25,1,223,18,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
