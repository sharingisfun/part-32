There is no point to be made here. Only the hope that somewhere amidst all the run-on sentences, unnecessary profanity and poor grammar, readers will come away with some unique thoughts of their own. Perfect reading for artists, commuters and people who spend an inordinate amount of time on the toilet.\n\nSome writers pander to their audience and write whatever it is they think will sell. Others are bold enough to say what needs to be said.\n\nThen there is Lance Manion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b0f1088a059d94dcafe4248615522a3e9101f97","amp;dn":"Homo+sayswhaticus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b0f1088a059d94dcafe4248615522a3e9101f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,15,16,136,160,89,217,77,202,254,66,72,97,85,34,163,233,16,31,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
