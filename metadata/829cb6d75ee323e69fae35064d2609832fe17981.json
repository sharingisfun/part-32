It is scheduled for release through Domino Records on 26 January 2009 in the UK.\n\nThe album has reportedly been inspired by the &quot;heavy dub sound of Jamaican reggae stars.&quot; Alex Kapranos also stated the album has a &quot;streak of electronica&quot; but is still a mix of influences. He also commented it has &quot;..the heavy bass and space echo you would find on a dub mix.&quot; In a Rolling Stone interview, Kapranos stated the album is more of a dance than a rock record. In an interview with Billboard.com, Kapranos said &quot;It's the opposite of punk/pop, which took something that was wonderful and removed all the dirt.&quot; He also said the band is using Russian Polyvox synthesizers. The album has somewhat of an African influence according to an XFM article in which Alex reeled, &quot;We're one of these bands that are always gonna sound the same no matter what we do, but there are other influences there. I guess the drums are a little different, Paul has been listening to a lot of African stuff so that's gonna come through.&quot; The song &quot;No You Girls&quot; uses a human skeleton for percussion. &quot;Tonight is more of a concept album that explores the highs and lows associated with an evening of debauchery. This album covers all its bases from the initial excitement of the early evening to the numbness of the morning after.&quot;, writes one reviewer.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Ulysses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n   2. &quot;Turn It On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:23\n   3. &quot;No You Girls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n   4. &quot;Send Him Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n   5. &quot;Twilight Omens&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:32\n   6. &quot;Bite Hard&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n   7. &quot;What She Came For&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n   8. &quot;Live Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n   9. &quot;Can't Stop Feeling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n  10. &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:57\n  11. &quot;Dream Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n  12. &quot;Katherine Kiss Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:829cb6d75ee323e69fae35064d2609832fe17981","amp;dn":"Franz+Ferdinand+-+Tonight+%28Unreleased%29+HIGH+COMPRESSION+26%2F02%2F09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"829cb6d75ee323e69fae35064d2609832fe17981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,156,182,215,94,227,35,230,159,174,53,6,77,38,9,131,47,225,121,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
