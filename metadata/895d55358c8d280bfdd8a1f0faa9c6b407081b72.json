Two assassins Soul and Shang, find a window of opportunity to\n  strike while all their enemies can be found in one place. Their mission is\n  simple: take down all their enemies or die in the attempt. They will face\n  many challenges and discover lost secrets as they embark on a perilous\n  journey against terrible odds.\n\n  Take control of Soul and Shang and wield two separate martial arts styles to\n  defeat their foes.\n\n  Soul is an orphan born with the temperament of a master. His skills are\n  self-taught and so lack refinement, but his potential is undeniable. He\n  favors Dark Wound, a short bladed weapon given to him by his adoptive father,\n  rumored to be one of the Night Masters..\n\n  Shang Zuo is a calm, unflappable fighter of average skill, but who possesses\n  a centered view of all things powerful enough to influence physical objects.\n  This Sword Temper skill allows him to destroy objects without moving a muscle\n  and to knock arrows out of the sky with but a single thought. Together they\n  will face the unknown and harness new skills as they face down a terrible\n  conspiracy.\n\n  Mirage Features\n  * 2 against the world Tag team in and out as either protagonist at any time.\n  * or play together for local multiplayer experience\n  * Gear up  Discover new weapons, abilities, and unique items to bloody your\n  foes.\n  * 8 distinct levels  Fight your way through an army of minions and face a\n  true challenge by encountering a unique Boss at every Stage.\n  * Learn the truth  Secrets abound and the full story of Mirage may be\n  discovered by a collection of books, letters, and drawings strewn about the\n  martial world.
