A year later it got its official anointment by the World Serpent Distribution label. According to Wikipedia this company died of exhaustion in 2004. Hence I dare sharing the CD.\n\n---------------------------------\nDeath in June - The Guilty Have no Pride\n              - Leper Lord\n              - Solitude\n              - Heaven Street\nCurrent 93    - Summer of Love\n              - Death of The Corn\n              - A Song for Douglas\n              - Earth Covers Earth\n              - Be\n              - Black Sun Bloody Moon\n              - Hooves/ Horsey\n              - Happy Birthday\n              - They Return to Their Earth\n              - Black Flowers\n              - Hullo Angel\n              - A Sadness Song\nSol Invictus  - Raven Chorus\n              - Black Easter\n              - Death of The West\n              \nTotal: 1:10:12\n----------------------------------\n\nSee also: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Death-In-June-Current-93-Sol-Invictus-Frankfurt-Sound-Depot-24-03-1991/release/388471&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Death-In-June-Current-93-Sol-Invictus-Frankfurt-Sound-Depot-24-03-1991/release/388471&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/label/World+Serpent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/label/World+Serpent&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote: Track 10 is incorrectly listed as &quot;North&quot;, so the mru file says.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e1f3987c138310f85c88e9e4c4e12d0b8f2526f","amp;dn":"Current+93%2C+Death+In+June%2C+Sol+Invictus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e1f3987c138310f85c88e9e4c4e12d0b8f2526f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,31,57,135,193,56,49,15,133,200,142,158,76,78,18,208,184,242,82,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
