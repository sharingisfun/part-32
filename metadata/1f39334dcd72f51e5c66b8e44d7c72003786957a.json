Jaco, Clarke, Egan, Hellborg and others had long since paved the way for the use of the bass guitar as lead voice.  This paradigm shift has allowed later players to ignore the arbitrary limits put on the bass in the past because they arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even aware of them.  This has enabled a new a generation of players to excel technically and compositionally.  If you are unaware of any limitations, you have no boundaries.  One such bass player who is perfect for his time is Tony Grey.  Aside from his wonderful playing, he is proving to be a composer of great clarity.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChasing ShadowsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features an unusual instrumentation.  To envision a harmonica, bass trumpet and electric bass melding together in a composition requires a truly open imagination.  All of the musicians perform superbly on the hummable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Chasing Shadows. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But the real star is the composition itself.  It is a fully formed piece that has both a real jazz feeling and a pop sensibility.  That is one hell of a difficult thing to achieve without the music sounding like that brain-cell draining sludge Smooth Jazz.  ( Pardon me while I gag. ) GreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bass-playing prowess and writing skills look like the making for a very long and fruitful road ahead.  ~ Walter Kolosky, Jazz.com \n\nPersonnel: Tony Grey: bass;\nChris Dave: drums (1, 3, 5, 7);\nRonald Bruner, Jr: drums (4, 6, 8, 9);\nMartin Valihora: drums (2);\nOliver Rockberger: piano, keyboards;\nHiromi: piano (7);\nTim Miller: guitar (4, 7);\nJohn Shannon: guitar (9);\nLionel Loueke: guitar(6, 8);\nElliot Mason: trombone (5), bass trumpet (1, 4);\nGregoire Maret: harmonica (1, 3, 5);\nBob Reynolds: soprano saxophone (2), tenor saxophone (8);\nDan Brantigan: trumpet (3) \n\nTony Grey - Chasing Shadows Tracklisting:\n01  Chasing Shadows \n02  Walking in Walking Out \n03  Guiding Light \n04  No Mans Land \n05  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Look for Love \n06  Peace of Mind \n07  Dark Within \n08  One of Those Lives \n09  Where Does It End\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f39334dcd72f51e5c66b8e44d7c72003786957a","amp;dn":"Tony+Grey+-+Chasing+Shadows+%282008%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f39334dcd72f51e5c66b8e44d7c72003786957a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,57,51,77,205,114,245,30,92,102,184,228,77,124,114,0,55,134,149,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
