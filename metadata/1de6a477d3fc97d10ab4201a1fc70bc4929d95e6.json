Turn on the news today and you will hear numerous reports of conflicts and problems across the globe. Listen for very long, and it becomes obvious that tensions surrounding the tiny country of Israel are among the top stories.\n\n Using events happening before our eyes, Pastor Kevin Lea analyzes the meaning behind two of the most interesting and dire prophecies of the Bible. Found in Isaiah 17 and Psalm 83, these prophecies describe a devastating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and her neighbors.\n\n Isaiah 17:1 says &quot;Behold, Damascus will cease from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.&quot;\n\n With ancient hatred of the Jews continuing to our day, war in the Middle East has happened before and is expected to happen again. But the city of Damascus made a ruinous heap? With modern weaponry and current tensions, this Biblical prophecy has never seemed so close to fulfillment.\n\n Join Pastor Kevin in this two part study as he explores the timing and circumstances of the conflict that sparks this terrible judgment on Damascus and will change the world.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n MAYHEM IN THE MIDDLE EAST with Guest Avi Lipkin:\n Avi breaks down current middle-east events and the global problems facing the Muslim faith.  Learn the in's and out's not discussed in the media and often overlooked by Christian preachers. \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n PSALM 83, THE MISSING PROPHECY REVEALED:\n Guest Bill Salus discusses his new book, Publication Date: February 5, 2013.\n An ancient prophecy written over 3000 years ago reveals that the Arab states and terrorist populations, which presently share common borders with Israel, will soon confederate in order to wipe Israel off of the map. These enemies of Israel are depicted on the red arrows upon the book cover image, and their mandate is clear: They have said, &quot;Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.&quot; (Psalm 83:4). Psalm 83 predicts a climactic, concluding Arab-Israeli war that has eluded the discernment of today's top Bible scholars, and yet, the Middle East stage appears to be set for the fulfillment of this prophecy. While many of today's top Bible experts are predicting that Russia, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and several other countries are going to invade Israel according to the prophecy in Ezekiel 38, this timely book explains how Psalm 83 occurs prior. Discover how Israel defeats their ancient Arab enemies, and why Americans need to stand beside Israel in this coming war! This book is an updated version of Isralestine, The Ancient Blueprints of the Future Middle East, which was written by the same author. This updated version includes over 17 new chapters and appendices.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The Future of the Middle East... Psalm 83 vs Ezekiel 38-39 by Bill Salus:\n On 11-6-2011, Bill Salus discusses... What does God's Word, the Bible, say about the Middle East and the next Prophetic Fulfillment of Bible Prophecy?\n Is it the Ezekiel 38-39 Battle of Gog-Magog as is currently the majority consensus? Or, as in the days when Jesus walked this earth, is Bible Prophecy about to be fulfilled in ways we didn't expect?\n Enter Psalm 83....\n Set to explode in the not so distant future, is a devastating war in the Middle East. Watch Bill Salus talk about his recent book - ISRALESTINE; The Ancient Blueprints of the Future Middle East, as he unveils significant Bible Prophecy that has eluded the discernment of today's great scholars.\n Once upon a foretold time the Jewish people were to meet with a holocaust type condition, out from which they would return back to their ancient homeland of Israel. They would begin as refugees, but promptly emerge into an exceedingly great army. As per Psalm 83, destiny's design for this great army is a head to head confrontation with a formidable Arab confederacy consisting of Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Jordanians, Saudis, Egyptians, and associated terrorist groups like the Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al-Qaeda.\n None of these are named in Ezekiel's list of countries that participate in the Battle of Gog-Magog in Ezekiel 38-39, yet they ARE listed in Psalm 83!\n The Arab Spring has set the stage for the unfolding of God's Prophetic End-time Scenario as outlined in Psalm 83.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n The Future of America in Bible Prophecy - Ezekiel 38-39 by Bill Salus:\n On 11-06-11, Bill Salus answers questions many people want to know....  Where is America in God's Prophetic plan concerning the End Time scenario as outlined in the Prophecies of Scripture. Is it really possible that America, the greatest superpower in world history, is absent from the world's stage as events that lead up the return of Jesus Christ unfold daily before our eyes.\n Is America about to be judged by God Himself? Is God already judging America? Is America the Babylon that God tells us about in Revelation 18, as some believe? Can America be found in Ezekiel 38-39? Does the dire warning from the Creator of the Universe found in Joel 3:2 apply to America? The answers may surprise you, Watch as Bill Salus, author of the bestselling Isralestine, discusses &quot; The Future of America in Bible Prophecy.&quot;\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Keiser Report - Selling Syria:\n In this Sept. 10, 2013 episode of the Keiser Report, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, discuss 'financial terror,' cluster bombs and protestors without portfolios. They also discuss Standard &amp; Poor's 'blasting' the $5 billion fraud lawsuit against them as retaliation for the rating agency's 2011 decision to strip the United States of its AAA credit rating. In the second half, Max talks to comedian, Lee Camp, about banks and corporate greed monkeys.  See how all the knots are tied together and its connection to the 'end-game'.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Signs - Part 33:\n A compilation of various short clips presenting the apocalyptic signs which are occurring around the world today and help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.

Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\n Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\n The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\n In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n &quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n &quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
