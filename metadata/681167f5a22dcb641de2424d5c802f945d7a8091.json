It's still growing on me though and may well become my favourite. Daniel Denis from UNIVERS ZERO is back guesting on percussion.\n\n As usual ART ZOYD starts off their record with a long epic. &quot;La Ville&quot; opens with a dark, tension filled soundscape.This is great ! Violins come in to add to the suspense. It changes after 2 1/2 minutes as horns,percussion and violin take over. Guitar 4 minutes in followed by a blast of horns after 5 minutes and a heavy beat. A collage of intricate sounds follow. This is incredible. Vocals yell with dissonant horns before a calm 6 1/2 minutes in. More vocals before 8 1/2 minutes with some great bass and violin. This is fairly heavy. More dissonant horns 9 1/2 minutes in. A calm with violin a minute later as it continues at a slow pace. It kicks back in before 14 minutes as lots of violin and horns end it. &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; is an uptempo track(what else) with some amazing interplay. Everyone seems to pitch in on this one.\n\n &quot;Divertissement&quot; opens with mournful violin melodies as cello comes in(or other way around). The tempo picks up after 2 minutes with lots of strings. It slows down 4 minutes in and sounds quite dark. It becomes almost waltz-like to end it. &quot;Trois Miniatures&quot; blew me away the first time i heard it because it sounds like Canterbury. The keys especially really give it that flavour. I like the intricate guitar as well. Some crazy violin 2 1/2 minutes in with some odd sounds. Back to the Canterbury vibe 3 1/2 minutes in. Some heavy bass follows and intricate guitar. Great track ! &quot;Generation Sans Futur&quot; has this heavy undercurrent to open with percussion as violin comes in. Horns 2 minutes in. It calms right down beautifully before 4 minutes, then heavy ground shaking sounds come and go. Check out the bass 5 minutes in as horns blast. The tempo then starts to pick up as piano and all kinds of intricate sounds come in. Chaotic and intense 6 1/2 minutes in. A calm 8 minutes in as violin plays.\n\n Well all i can say is that the first three albums by ART ZOYD are nothing short of incredible.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681167f5a22dcb641de2424d5c802f945d7a8091","amp;dn":"Art+Zoyd++Generation+Sans+Futur+++1980","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681167f5a22dcb641de2424d5c802f945d7a8091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,17,103,245,162,45,203,100,29,226,66,77,92,128,47,148,93,122,128,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
