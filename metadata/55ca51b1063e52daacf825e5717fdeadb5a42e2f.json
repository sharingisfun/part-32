The T-Bones became a victim of their own success when they recorded their own version of a catchy jingle used by Alka-Seltzer, calling it &quot;No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In)&quot;.  The song became a hit in 1965 and Liberty was compelled to come up with a performing version of the group to follow up on the song's success.\n\n1.  No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In) \n2.
