Is it an obscure Italian or Portuguese term that\nreflects this ensemble's mix of two Italian and two Portuguese musicians? No it\nis not. It's an anagram of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDe Patter Quartet, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which was named after the De\nPater jazz club in Haia, The Netherlands...\n\nDe Pater jazz club: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.patermuziek.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.patermuziek.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews\n~~~~~~~\nby Stef\n\nThis band's curious name is a defective anagram of De Pater Quartet, referring\nto MuzikantencafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© De Pater in The Hague, The Netherlands, a place which this\nband apparently likes a lot, and for which an &quot;r&quot; is missing, hence the\ntitle. There is nothing wrong with the music, though, quite on the contrary. The\nband consists of Belgian-Italian Daniele Martini on tenor sax, Belgian-Italian\npianist Giovanni di Domenico, Portuguese bassist GonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§alo Almeida who resides in\nRotterdam, and Portuguese drummer JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Lobo. Whatever their origin, I must again\ncongratulate Pedro Costas of Clean Feed for his unbelievable ear for good music,\nand for giving young musicians the chance to have their music released. The\nmusic of Tetterapadequ consists of 13 mostly short tracks of improvised music,\nmostly subdued, introverted and restrained, with the exception of the third\ntrack &quot;Dopey&quot;, which is a short drum solo. The four musicians create small\ncreative aural environments, with scarce sounds, lots of empty space. Di\nDomenico's piano usually sets the tone and the scene. Although some of the\nsounds come from extended techniques on the various instruments, the music is\nvery accessible and intimate, between traditional jazz (there is even a short\nreference to Glenn Miller's Moonlight Serenade) and modern classical music, with\nthe other musicians taking the overall sound to a higher stage, creating depth\nand perspectives that are new and fresh. They are not afraid to push things to\nthe limit, as on the last track, when the first four minutes are nothing but\nsilence, then the bass starts playing softly, with the piano strings being\nplucked gently, then the drum joins sparingly, and only after eight minutes can\nthe sax be heard, hesitatingly, sensitively, over a one note piano rhythm, yet\ngaining in power, gaining momentum, hypnotically, majestically, ending in a\nscream/cough/laugh. Nice music, very creative and subtle.\n\n--\n\ndi Vittorio Lo Conte (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3473&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=3473&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor YahvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© M. de la Cavada (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2009-02-01#t_atmr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2009-02-01#t_atmr&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0129374784e589a441029d285557b7d19032e4b8","amp;dn":"Tetterapadequ+-+And+The+Missing+R+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0129374784e589a441029d285557b7d19032e4b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,41,55,71,132,229,137,164,65,2,157,40,85,87,183,209,144,50,228,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
