The show is produced by Williams Street Studios for the Adult Swim programming block of Cartoon Network. It was created by Matt Maiellaro and Pete Smith and is written by Dave Willis, of Aqua Teen Hunger Force fame, and Jim Fortier, previously of The Brak Show, both of whom worked on Space Ghost Coast to Coast. The animation is done by Radical Axis, with background design by Ben Prisk. The series has thus far aired forty episodes in three seasons with a fourth season in production. Squidbillies follows the exploits of the Cuyler family and their interactions with the local populace, which usually results in a fair amount of destruction, mutilation, and death. Themes include the family's overt racism against white people (Chalkies), Early's dalliances with Krystal, their sketchy friendship with the Sheriff, run-ins with celebrities, their crushing poverty, and the machinations of corporate executive Dan Halen.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidbillies\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457146/\n\nCreators: Jim Fortier, Matt Maiellaro, Dave Willis.\nDirectors: Jim Fortier, Dave Willis.\nWriters: Jim Fortier, Dave Willis, Matt Maiellaro, Chris 'Casper' Kelly.\nStarring: Unknown Hinson, Daniel McDevitt, Dana Snyder (Voice of &quot;Master Shake&quot; from Aqua Teen Hunger Force), Todd Hanson, Bobby R.
