They are all popular, good looking, the kids voted most likely to succeed. But at their core lies a cruelty and shallowness which comes with the territory of privilege. One night, a prank goes horribly wrong and a teenager is killed. The gang covers it up as a drowning accident but five years later, their lives are turned upside down when Jimmy Edwards, is killed by a serial killer wearing a haunting Marilyn Monroe mask. Soon, the gang are killed one by one in manners mirroring the pranks they pulled in high school. Is it revenge? Is it karma? Is it the dead boy's spirit coming back to avenge his death? Is it his twin brother, Liam, who has come to Grace Arbor asking questions?One thing is certain...No one is laughing now.\r\n\r\nDirector: Robert Mearns\r\nWriter: Robert Mearns\r\nStars: Pierson Fode, Joe Adler, Laura Ashley Samuels \r\nGenres: Horror\r\nCountry: USA\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE: Kill.Game.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO\r\n                                             \r\n SOURCE: 720p - Thanks friend!                                               \r\n\r\n ViDEO: 1500 kbps XviD               \r\n\r\n RESOLUTiON: 720x400                           \r\n\r\n RUNTiME: 1h42m33sec      \r\n\r\n SUBTiTLES: N/A                               \r\n\r\n AUDiO: 384 Kbps AC3        \r\n\r\n LANGUAGE: ENGLiSH                                    \r\n\r\n NOTES: Enjoy.\r\n\r\n SPECIAL THANKS TO: The Big Boss WIGWIG, ANSA, ACHOSINK,\r\n                 HAMADA, MAZENTBT, CD-Moonlight. \r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/rIB \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/rIC \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/rIY \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/rIp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1df2e7022f5b4964a99d8ca7a17db3903312153","amp;dn":"Kill.Game.2015.HDRip.XviD.AC3-EVO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1df2e7022f5b4964a99d8ca7a17db3903312153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,223,46,112,34,245,180,150,74,153,216,202,122,23,219,57,3,49,33,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
