While the premise of a singing synthesizer duo may now be a fairly conventional concept, Andy McClusky and Paul Humphreys had very few role models when they first developed their unusual style. This package pulls together two full decades of OMD's distinctive pop craftsmanship. From the early sounds of &quot;Enola Gay&quot; to radio classics like &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and &quot;Souvenir&quot;, OMD's polished, dramatic readings influenced everyone from Depeche Mode to the Pet Shop Boys. Late-1980s tunes like &quot;If You Leave&quot; and &quot;(Forever) Live and Die&quot; round out this collection. While not displaying all the more offbeat aspects of OMD's music, The Best of Omd certainly delivers the hits. --Mitch Myers\n1. Electricity\n2. Messages\n3. Enola Gay\n4. Souvenir\n5.
