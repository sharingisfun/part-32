Sven Coop was released on January 19, 1999 - before Valve's Team Fortress Classic - and is therefore the oldest Half-Life mod in existence that is still in development. It has since grown to become a full blown mod, with a full team, and one of the most played games on Steam as of September 18, 2006, excluding the official games by Valve.\n\nYou will need HL1 (Half Life 1) purchased on your Steam account and installed, or find a non-Steam HL1 somewhere. HL1 is cheap to buy, and most of the Sven Coop servers are Steam based. This is a fun, free, legal mod.\n\nEnjoy, have fun, and seed please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32bda02a3bc434c07e0296338737da5f56332025","amp;dn":"Sven+Co-op+v4.6+%5BHL1+Mod%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32bda02a3bc434c07e0296338737da5f56332025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,189,160,42,59,196,52,192,126,2,150,51,135,55,218,95,86,51,32,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
