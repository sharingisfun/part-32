ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a totally different device in terms of construction where all the compression magic happens inside an optically coupled element formed by a fluorescent panel and some photocells: the famed T4A element. There is no electronic circuitry involved with the compression itself. It's just a tube amp with photo-resistors, lighted by a fluorescent panel driven by the output signal. At the time of this invention, there were not many ways of making an audio compressor: only variable-mu and optical. Optical was the simplest one, and if proper elements for both the light emitting panel and the photocells were matched, magic happened.\n\nHomepage - http://www.ikmultimedia.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e61253266ec96e9322f8ac346f05f0939591ad","amp;dn":"IK+Multimedia+T-Racks+Singles+White+2A+Limiting+Amplifier+3.5+AU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e61253266ec96e9322f8ac346f05f0939591ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,230,18,83,38,110,201,110,147,34,248,172,52,111,5,240,147,149,145,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
