The writing here would later shape his work on Dreadstar.\n\nWhat issues I found will be complete storylines, but the collection isn't quite comprehensive. Missing are Fantastic Four 66 - 67 and Strange Tales 178 - 181 (the beginning of the Starlin run).\n\nThanks again to shipjolly for uploading Avengers Annual 07 for this; if any of you have the pure digital files that make this a complete collection, please remix and reup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c74130c7e93e6f798303b61f808273fddc1d422","amp;dn":"Warlock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c74130c7e93e6f798303b61f808273fddc1d422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,116,19,12,126,147,230,247,152,48,59,97,248,8,39,63,221,193,212,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
