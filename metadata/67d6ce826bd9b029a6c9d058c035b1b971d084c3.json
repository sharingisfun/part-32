Ersel had a hit in the 50s with Bluebirds Over The Mountain. Ersel met Phil Everly (Everly Brothers), who encouraged him to write his own material. So he did. Hickey wrote songs recorded by Richie Valens, The Beach Boys, Jackie Wilson &amp; Lavern Baker too.  Ersel is in the Rockabilly Hall Of Fame. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a true rock and roll pioneer. This is our take on this wild jumper!\n \nWritten by Ersel Hickey\n \nTIm Timebomb-Vocals, Guitar\nJim Doyle-Drums\nBrett Simons- Bass\nHunter Perrin- Guitar\nJohn Morrical- Piano","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67d6ce826bd9b029a6c9d058c035b1b971d084c3","amp;dn":"Goin%27+Down+That+Road+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67d6ce826bd9b029a6c9d058c035b1b971d084c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,214,206,130,107,217,176,41,166,201,208,88,192,53,177,185,113,208,132,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
