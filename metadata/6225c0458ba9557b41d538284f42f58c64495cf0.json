Led by the charming frontline of crooner/rhythm guitarist Doug Sammons and ukelele-strumming chanteuse Dee Settlemier, the Serenaders' repertoire consists of specially chosen gems from the past, as well as vintage sounding original songs. The Midnight Serenaders are based in Portland, Oregon and perform at clubs and events throughout the Pacific Northwest, continuing to delight audiences with their brand of hot retro swing. This latest recording captures the band in their prime with new Hawaiian Steel guitarist Doc Stein, along with special guests Andrew Oliver on piano and drums, Aquiles Montas on guiro, and the vocal trio Libertine Belles on vocals.
