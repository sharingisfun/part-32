Carol Decker was still a likable lead singer, and T'Pau still offered high-gloss material that -- although heavily produced and undeniably slick -- usually didn't sound like it came off a musical assembly line. The puzzling thing was that T'Pau continued to be much better-known in England than in the U.S. Indeed, commercial, radio-minded songs like &quot;Made of Money,&quot; &quot;Only a Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Soul Destruction&quot; begged the question: if American listeners could accept Roxette, why not T'Pau? The Promise isn't remarkable, but it isn't a bad listen either. - All Music Review by Alex Henderson\n\n\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Soul Destruction\n[02] Whenever You Need Me\n[03] Walk On Air\n[04] Made Of Money\n[05] Hold On To Love\n[06] Strange Place\n[07] One Direction\n[08] Only A Heartbeat\n[09] The Promise\n[10] A Place In My Heart\n[11] Man And Woman\n[12] Purity\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:50m:04s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 124mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
