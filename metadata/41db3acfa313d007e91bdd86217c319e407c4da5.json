Now, there are rumors that a fellow survivor of the battle has escaped from captivity and is seeking the Grey Wardens' help. The time has come to make your return to Ostagar and exact revenge upon the darkspawn. Includes: (1) A return to the battlefields of Ostagar, now thick with darkspawn encamped amidst the snow. (2) An opportunity to regain the lost arms and armor of a king. (3) A second chance to add Dog to your party. To find the survivor: (1) Play through Dragon Age: Origins until after the village of Lothering. (2) Travel to Bann Loren's Lands along the Bannorn's northwest border.\n\n- Warden's Keep\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Grey Wardens were expelled from Ferelden amidst a storm of blood and betrayal. Their fortress remains at remote Soldier's Peak, overgrown and reportedly haunted. Now comes a chance to unearth this lost chapter of Grey Warden history, to unravel the mystery behind its fall, and finally reclaim it for the order! To begin the journey to Soldier's Peak, return to your party camp from the world map and seek out a merchant named Levi Dryden. Includes: (1) A fun dungeon-delving adventure; (2) A set of ancient Grey Warden armor, complete with heraldry; (3) A chance to gain two of six mysterious new abilities. (4) A new base complete with merchants and a party chest to store your hard-earned loot.\n\n- The Stone Prisoner\n\nSome versions of Dragon Age: Origins contain a redemption code to obtain this content for free. Check your game's packaging before purchasing. Crafted by the ancient dwarves as their first line of defense against the darkspawn, the dread sentinels known as golems dwindled in number after the art of their creation was lost. Shale, one of the few golems remaining, was found in the Deep Roads, reactivated and brought to the surface, and may prove to be the Grey Wardens' most effective weapon against the onslaught of the Blight. Includes: (1) Shale, a unique and powerful golem, as a recruitable party member who is fully integrated into the main Dragon Age: Origins campaign. (2) Brand new plots and adventure areas. (3) Fantastic new items.\n\n- Promo Item Pack 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41db3acfa313d007e91bdd86217c319e407c4da5","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+Origins+DLC+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41db3acfa313d007e91bdd86217c319e407c4da5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,219,58,207,163,19,208,7,233,27,221,134,33,124,49,158,64,124,77,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
