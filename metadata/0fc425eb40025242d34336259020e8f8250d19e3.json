The volume contains two major sections: one on cognitive neuroscience and another on computational modeling. The section on cognitive neuroscience will focus on major cognitive processes like learning, perception (especially time perception), attention, language and reasoning and the neural bases for those cognitive processes. The second section on computational modeling will focus on computational modeling of neural and cognitive functions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fc425eb40025242d34336259020e8f8250d19e3","amp;dn":"Progress+in+Brain+Research+Volume+176+Attention+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fc425eb40025242d34336259020e8f8250d19e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,196,37,235,64,2,82,66,211,67,54,37,144,32,232,248,37,13,25,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
