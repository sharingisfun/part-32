In addition to keeping her small business afloat, Reiko must deal with her meddling in-laws, who have their minds set on selling the grocery store, and also attend to Koji, who inexplicably indulges in a rebellious cycle of petty crime and violence. One of Naruse's great talents is in making the mundane mysterious so when Koji declares, seemingly out of nowhere, that he's been in love with Reiko for years, it takes more than a few moments to acclimate to the film's suddenly malleable emotional terrain, even though, in retrospect, it makes perfect psychological sense. It's a shock to witness how charged and raw the duo become after Koji's admission, and Naruse's camera, under the guiding eye of cinematographer Jun Yasumoto, never blinks, maintaining a harsh, voyeuristic presence as the characters move, like increasingly frenzied celestial bodies, through a space made unfamiliar because of a naked confessional moment.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Midareru.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,467,984,302 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:38:10\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x320 (AR: 2.250)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1856 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.336 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 44100 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058349/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058349/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by Ewolve, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94ad1191c96ade56ea5e15e51a54cf15712a8d23","amp;dn":"Naruse+-+Midareru+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94ad1191c96ade56ea5e15e51a54cf15712a8d23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,173,17,145,201,106,222,86,234,94,21,229,26,84,207,21,113,42,141,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
