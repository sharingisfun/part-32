Series 1\n\nHealth-Medical Documentary hosted by Eric Meyers, published by Discovery Channel in 2011 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nInfested! Series 1\nRoaches! Rats! And bats! Oh my! Is your skin crawling? It will you tune in to Infested! This show unearths the real-life horror stories of ordinary people plagued by extraordinary infestations inside their homes. We're not talking about the occasional bug slipping through a crack in your wall - it's a full-on war for the victims whose nightmares are relived this season. Every one of these victims has suffered either physical harm or psychological trauma. Some of them may never feel safe and sound again. This season, get up close and personal with nature's nastiest squatters, including spiders, opossums, bedbugs, scorpions, bats and rats - all of which can spill out from the tiniest orifices and create a living terror. Each spine-tingling story is enhanced by macro-lens photography and stunning CGI recreations, which reveal how these critters, strip humans of the four walls that protect them from the outside world. Infested! Is more than enough to make everyone shiver and check twice under the bed?\n\n\n1)  Bedbugs Rats and Scorpions \nSometimes, the desire to get away from it all can bring us closer to nature than we ever planned. In Oregon, a woman is left dangerously ill after being bitten by one the thousands of hobo spiders that have taken up residence in her new home. A family in Idaho faces losing their home as a snake infestation spreads from the yard to the house. And a young family in Georgia discovers that their new home is built on top of a giant ant colony that stretches a thousand miles across the country.\n\n2)  Spiders Snakes and Ants \nThree families fight for their homes as they are overrun by vermin. In New Jersey, a dream home becomes a battleground as a family goes to war against an ever-growing number of bedbugs. A single mother defends her home and children against an invading army of rats. And in Arizona, a family discovers their new home is a haven for deadly scorpions.\n\n3)  Roaches Mice and Raccoons \nDespite our best efforts, vermin will find a way into our homes. A family battles against an invasion of cockroaches, the walls and floors of their apartment seething with the creatures. An Australian town is threatened with extinction as millions of mice flood streets and fields, destroying everything in sight. And in Wisconsin, a family is hospitalized after the urine and excrement of invading raccoons poisons the air of their apartment building.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/993/1t38.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/993/1t38.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/7443/36dx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/7443/36dx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/6053/g3ev.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/6053/g3ev.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5789/406e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/5789/406e.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/6966/vid1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/6966/vid1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/8915/cket.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/8915/cket.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/4166/wb7m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/4166/wb7m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9651/sg60.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9651/sg60.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/7826/0pod.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/7826/0pod.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/5194/kuqx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/5194/kuqx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/6787/gn2v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/6787/gn2v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/7483/sdb4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/7483/sdb4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2f674648476f631c011e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2001 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 43mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 660 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n * Release Notes\n * Merged subtitles\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/infested&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/infested&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea3b91e930c7eb940d27aa628e66a6aed13f6a4","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Infested+Series+1+3of3+Roaches+Mice+and+Raccoons+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea3b91e930c7eb940d27aa628e66a6aed13f6a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,163,185,30,147,12,126,185,64,210,122,166,40,230,106,106,237,19,246,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
