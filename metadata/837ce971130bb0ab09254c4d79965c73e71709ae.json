But the    \nmusic they make as A Mountain Of One would only    \nhave value in discotheques with beds: it has      \nalready been tagged by those canny folk at Vice    \nmagazine as &quot;future Balearic classics&quot;. AMO1      \nthemselves recall the experimental dance outfits  \nof the early 90s such as Ultramarine and the Orb,  \nwhose epic, exploratory ambient techno was        \nsteeped in krautrock and the &quot;Canterbury Scene&quot;    \nof Soft Machine et al. Early-70s fetishists,      \ntheir songs, often 10 minutes long, are slow and  \nmeanderingly melodic, and their ambition is to    \nmake the 21st century Dark Side Of The Moon.      \nTheir lead singer has the tremulous voice of a    \nlatter-day Bryan Ferry and their music is epic    \nwith pretensions towards the elegiac and          \nexquisite.                                        \nA Mountain Of One love the 70s, only instead of    \npunk and disco it&amp;#039;s to the proggy and dreamy,      \nelegant yet enervated West Coast 70s of the Floyd  \nand Fleetwood Mac that they aspire: Ride, their    \nlimited-edition debut single from last summer      \nwhich sold out in days, recalled the luscious MOR  \nmotorik of Lindsey Buckingham&amp;#039;s compositions for  \nthe Mac. The recent EP2, which also sold out      \nimmediately, furthered their adventures beyond    \nthe ambient-techno ultraworld in fine style: lead  \ntracks Innocent Line and People Without Love      \n(featuring beat poet Jamie Kelsey) are typical of  \nAMO1&amp;#039;s serene electronica, reminiscent of          \nAvalon-era Roxy Music, with its sense of a        \npastoral idyll in the urban jungle. New single    \nBrown Piano is to be lifted as a single from      \ntheir forthcoming EP compilation, and comes with  \na remix from Swedish GUM favourites Studio. It    \nwas recorded at James Lavelle/Unkle&amp;#039;s All          \nSurrender studio with Pablo Clements of            \nPsychonauts, with whom they achieved the song&amp;#039;s    \nstrange, disorientating effect, making it sound    \nas though it could have come from any period from  \nthe last 35 years of sonic British invention. The  \nStudio remix accentuates the slow-but-steady chug  \nof AMO1&amp;#039;s dubbishly spacious psych-kraut motorik  \nMOR.                                              \nA Mountain Of One&amp;#039;s Collected Works is not a      \ngreatest hits compilation but rather the debut    \nalbum release, made up of two EPs and one new      \ntrack, from a London-based collective consisting  \nof three core members. It is unlike any other      \nalbum you&amp;#039;ll hear this year.                      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:837ce971130bb0ab09254c4d79965c73e71709ae","amp;dn":"%5BPSYCHEDELIC%5DA_Mountain_Of_One-Collected_Works-%28AMRCD01%29-CD-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"837ce971130bb0ab09254c4d79965c73e71709ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,124,233,113,19,11,176,171,9,37,76,77,121,150,92,115,231,23,9,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
