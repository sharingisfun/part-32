The traders are from from London, New York and Hong Kong and they work either for the banks forex department or as a private trader running a fund.  On that particular day, it shows how they make or lose money trading 1 Billion Dollars.  It will be very interesting for modern traders to see how these people traded back in 1986, when all that they used was a phone and some simple computer equipment, employing various strategies and tactics to gain the upper hand against their counterparts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1437557289dc6b0b1e0dac74950fdf57ccae9082","amp;dn":"Billion+Dollar+Day+-+BBC+Documentary+-+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1437557289dc6b0b1e0dac74950fdf57ccae9082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,55,85,114,137,220,107,11,30,13,172,116,149,15,223,87,204,174,144,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
