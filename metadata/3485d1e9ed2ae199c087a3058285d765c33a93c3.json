Install Macrium Reflect x86 for 32 bit operating system and x64 for 64 bit operating system\r\n2. Copy the path file (x86 for 32bit version and x64 for 64bit version) to the installed folder\r\n3. Patch and it's done\r\nNOTE: Please block the application from connecting to the internet using a firewall, preventing issues with the crack.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes: 6.1.887\r\n\r\n    Delta Index restore problem\r\n    When restoring an Incremental with 'Delta Index', if there were zero changed blocks since the previous image in the set, then the restore process could fail to restore. This has been resolved.\r\n    If this issue affects you then please create fresh Windows PE rescue media after updating.\r\n    Rescue media driver update\r\n    Selecting a path with a very large number of files to scan for updated drivers could cause Reflect to crash. This has been resolved.\r\n    Powershell script event logging\r\n    Raising an event from a Macrium powershell script could cause the script to terminate early. This has been resolved","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3485d1e9ed2ae199c087a3058285d765c33a93c3","amp;dn":"Macrium+Reflect+Workstation+-+Server+-+Server+Plus+v6.1.887","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3485d1e9ed2ae199c087a3058285d765c33a93c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,133,209,233,237,42,225,153,192,135,163,5,130,133,215,101,195,58,147,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
