It is one of not too many Yugoslav films with medieval 14 century theme, so only for that, for me, it would be worth a look.\n\nDragan Nikolic is brilliant as Vlah Alija, with no other than Franco Nero as Banovic Strahinja. Rade Serbedzija is exceptional as a crazy dervish and the scene where he is tortured on the pike is more than powerful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2abfebcbe4d8b6cff6a7fdf7234bcd2b1bbb95","amp;dn":"Banovic+Strahinja","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2abfebcbe4d8b6cff6a7fdf7234bcd2b1bbb95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,42,191,235,203,228,216,182,207,246,167,253,247,35,75,205,43,27,187,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
