Big Pharma sucks.\n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Corporation:\nTHE CORPORATION is a Canadian documentary film written by Joel Bakan, and directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott. The documentary examines the modern-day corporation, considering its legal status as a class of person and evaluating its behavior towards society and the world at large as a psychiatrist might evaluate an ordinary person. This is explored through specific examples. Bakan wrote the book, The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, during the filming of the documentary.\n\nCorporations now have more legal rights than people, and people hide behind their corporations to protect themselves from liability and avoid personal accountability.  In a world without risk of tarnishing your reputation or losing your wealth via litigation, are we creating a society where irresponsibility, corruption and immorality is rewarded?  The dehumanization of business spells the death of personal freedom.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHot Coffee:\nThis documentary examines the infamous &quot;hot coffee lawsuit&quot; in which a woman sued McDonald's after she spilled her coffee and suffering horrindous 3rd degree burns, specifically looking at the reasons why the fast-food giant invested heaps of money to sway public opinion and similar cases that were exploited as part of a right wing crusade to weaken our civil justice system.  The public was duped by mainstream media and a misinformation agenda which allowed the corporate push for new legislation or tort reform.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlack 9 11 Money, Motive, Technology, and Plausible Deniability:\nSpecial thanks to Michael C.

Has the media finally found outrage over the Obama regimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s use of drone strikes to kill scores of innocent women and children in countries that are not even at war with the United States? Or the DOJÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent admission that the strikes had indeed killed American citizens? Or John KerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent attempts to once again lead the American public into supporting military intervention in the Middle East based on provably false claims of WMD?\n\nOf course not. No, the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sudden discovery of outrage is directed at an entirely different scandal: the fact that reporters have now allegedly found themselves in the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crosshairs.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire of this current controversy, it has recently been revealed that Fox News reporter James Rosen has been under investigation by the Justice Department as a possible co-conspirator in a case involving leaked State Department information on North Korean nuclear tests. Particularly galling is the fact that Attorney General Eric Holder personally signed off on the investigation and is now being charged with leading the investigation into the investigation....\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Trap: What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom (2007) by producer, Adam Curtis.\nThe series consists of three one-hour programs which explore the concept and definition of freedom, specifically, &quot;how a simplistic model of human beings as self-seeking, almost robotic, creatures led to today's idea of freedom.\nIf one steps back and looks at what freedom actually means for us today, it's a strange and limited kind of freedom. The West apparently fought the Cold War for &quot;individual freedom&quot;, yet it is still something our leaders continually promise to give us. Abroad, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the attempt to force &quot;freedom&quot; on to other people has led to bloody mayhem. This, in turn, has helped inspire terrorist attacks in Britain. In response, the government has dismantled long-standing laws that were designed to protect individual freedom...\n\nPart 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Fu You Buddy\nIn this episode, Curtis examines the rise of game theory during the Cold War and the way in which its mathematical models of human behavior filtered into economic thought. The program traces the development of game theory with particular reference to the work of John Nash, who constructed logically consistent and mathematically verifiable models, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Economics. He invented system games reflecting his beliefs about human behavior, including one he called &quot;Fuck You Buddy&quot; (later published as &quot;So Long Sucker&quot;), in which the only way to win was to betray your playing partner. These games were internally coherent and worked correctly as long as the players obeyed the ground rules that they should behave selfishly and try to outwit their opponents.\nPart 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Lonely Robot\nThe second episode reiterates many of the ideas of the first, but develops the theme that drugs such as Prozac and lists of psychological symptoms which might indicate anxiety or depression are being used to normalize behavior and make humans behave more predictably, like machines. This is not presented as a conspiracy, but as a logical although unpredicted outcome of market-driven self-diagnosis by checklists based on normal symptoms of human emotion.\n\nPart 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€ We Will Force You To Be Free\nThe final program focuses on the concepts of positive and negative liberty introduced in the 1950s by Isaiah Berlin. Curtis briefly explains how negative liberty could be defined as freedom from coercion and positive liberty as the opportunity to strive to fulfill one's potential.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJapan's Triple Meltdown - A Tour of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant:\nAfter the devasting Japanese EQ in 2011 which caused a meltdown at the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the global problems continue to worsen.  Learn what's been going on at the site and how it effects the global population.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
