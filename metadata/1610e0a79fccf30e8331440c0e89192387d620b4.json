The Lady in Red Kills Seven Times\na.k.a. The Red Queen Kills 7 Times\n\nHorror / Mystery / Thriller\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068444/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068444/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nA story about 2 sisters who find themselves caught up in an ancient tale of terror. After Kitty Wildenbruck and her sister Evelyn have a violent fight over a toy doll, we see from the start that Evelyn is possessed by the spirit of the legendary &quot;Red Queen&quot; who is shown in a painting on their grandfather's mansion wall. The two girls are told the tale by their grandfather of the Red Queen and the Black Queen, who were also sisters that hated one another. The story goes that every 100 years the Red Queen comes back for her revenge on the Black Queen, killing her and the seven people who are closest to her.\n\nFlash forward to 1972, 14 years after the story was first told to the girls. We learn that Evelyn has been gone for some time now and that Kitty and Evelyn's third sister, Franzika, is now taking care of their grandfather while working at a Fashion Design firm. One night, the grandfather hears someone approaching his room. We see the mysterious Red Queen in the shadows and Mr Wildenbruck is so frightened he has a heart attack. The estate is now in the hands of his grandchildren.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 704x288, 23.976 fps, 1354 kbps, 01h39m16s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\n\nDUAL AUDIO: 1) Italian\n            2) English\n\nOPTIONAL SUBTITLES: English\n                    French\n                    Polish\n                    Slovak\n                    Spanish\n                    Turkish\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/bAcFNaAGK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/bAcFNaAGK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BACfOAAGK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BACfOAAGK&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVD Rip, thanks to RL, June 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1610e0a79fccf30e8331440c0e89192387d620b4","amp;dn":"The+Lady+in+Red+Kills+Seven+Times+%281972+-+Italy%29+multi+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1610e0a79fccf30e8331440c0e89192387d620b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,16,224,167,159,204,243,14,131,49,68,12,14,137,25,35,135,214,32,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
