Santa! Pass us that bottle, will you?) \n\nLiving In The Past\n\nHappy and I'm smiling, \nwalk a mile to drink your water. \nYou know I'd love to love you, \nand above you there's no other. \nWe'll go walking out \nwhile others shout of war's disaster. \nOh, we won't give in, \nlet's go living in the past. \nOnce I used to join in \nevery boy and girl was my friend. \nNow there's revolution, but they don't know \nwhat they're fighting. \nLet us close out eyes; \noutside their lives go on much faster. \nOh, we won't give in, \nwe'll keep living in the past. \n\nDriving Song\n\nWill they ever stop drivin' me? \nHave they ever taken time to see \nThat I need some rest \nif I'm to do my best? \nCan I please stop workin' so hard? \nThey just tell me gotta close it hard. \nGot to think of my health. \nCan I be by myself? \n\nOh, they tell me I'll be home someday. \nWell I doubt it if I continue this way, \n`cause this hard life I've led \nis makin' me dead. \n\nBouree\n\n[Instrumental] \n\nSweet Dream\n\nYou'll hear me calling in your sweet dream, \ncan't hear your daddy's warning cry. \nYou're going back to be all the things you want to be, \nwhile in sweet dreams you softly sigh. \nYou hear my voice is calling \nto be mine again, \nlive the rest of your life in a day. \nGet out and get what you can \nwhile your mummy's at home a-sleeping. \nNo time to understand \n`cause they lost what they thought they were keeping. \n\nNo one can see us in your sweet dream. \ndon't hear you leave to start the car. \nAll wrapped up tightly in the coat you borrowed from me, \nyour place of resting is not far. \n\nYou'll hear my voice is calling \nto be mine again, \nlive the rest of your life in a day. \nGet out and get what you can \nWhile your mummy's at home a-sleeping. \nNo time to understand, \n`cause they lost what they thought they were keeping. \n\nSinging All Day\n\nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing. \nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing. \nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing, \noo, my, my, my, \noo, my, my, my. \nWent down to the station to look for her there, \nlooked through the crowds for a glimpse of her hair, \nnothing to see but the crowds keep a-staring at me, \nmy, my, \noo, my, my, my. \n\nDown in the street, try'n' to remember, \nshuffling my feet outside a menswear, \nis that her in the fur coat? \nNo it's not December yet, \nmy, my, my, \noo, my, my, my. \n\nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing. \n\nBack to the house, maybe she'll phone me, \nsinging my song, feeling so lonely. \nI'll sing very softly, so if the phone rings \nI can hear it, I can hear it. \n\nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing. \nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing. \nSinging all day, singing `bout nothing, \noo, my, my, my, \noo, my, my, my. \n\nTeacher\n\nWell the dawn was coming, \nheard him ringing on my bell. \nHe said, ``My name's the teacher, \nthat is what I call myself. \nAnd I have a lesson \nthat I must impart to you. \nIt's an old expression \nbut I must insist it's true. \nJump up, look around, \nfind yourself some fun, \nno sense in sitting there hating everyone. \nNo man's an island and his castle isn't home, \nthe nest is for nothing when the bird has flown.'' \n\nSo I took a journey, \nthrew my world into the sea. \nWith me went the teacher \nwho found fun instead of me. \n\nHey man, what's the plan, what was that you said? \nSun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed. \nI try to socialize but I can't seem to find \nwhat I was looking for, got something on my mind. \n\nThen the teacher told me \nit had been a lot of fun. \nThanked me for his ticket \nand all that I had done. \n\nHey man, what's the plan, what was that you said? \nSun-tanned, drink in hand, lying there in bed. \nI try to socialize but I can't seem to find \nwhat I was looking for, got something on my mind. \n\nWitch's Promise\n\nLend me your ear while I call you a fool. \nYou were kissed by a witch one night in the wood, \nand later insisted your feelings were true. \nThe witch's promise was coming, \nbelieving he listened while laughing you flew. \nLeaves falling red, yellow, brown, all are the same, \nand the love you have found lay outside in the rain. \nWashed clean by the water but nursing its pain. \nThe witch's promise was coming, and you're looking \nelsewhere for your own selfish gain. \n\nKeep looking, keep looking for somewhere to be, \nwell, you're wasting your time, they're not stupid like he is. \nMeanwhile leaves are still falling, you're too blind to see. \n\nYou won't find it easy now, it's only fair. \nHe was willing to give to you, you didn't care. \nYou're waiting for more but you've already had your share. \nThe witch's promise is turning, so don't you wait up \nfor him, he's going to be late. \n\nInside\n\nAll the places I've been make it hard to begin \nto enjoy life again on the inside, \nbut I mean to. \nTake a walk around the block \nand be glad that I've got me some time \nto be in from the outside, \nand inside with you. \nI'm sitting on the corner feeling glad. \nGot no money coming in but I can't be sad. \nThat was the best cup of coffee I ever had. \nAnd I won't worry about a thing \nbecause we've got it made, \nhere on the inside, outside so far away. \n\nAnd we'll laugh and we'll sing \nget someone to bring our friends here \nfor tea in the evening -- \nOld Jeffrey makes three. \nTake a walk in the park, \ndoes the wind in the dark \nsound like music to you? \nWell I'm thinking it does to me. \n\nCan you cook, can you sew -- \nwell, I don't want to know. \nThat is not what you need on the inside, \nto make the time go. \n\nCounting lambs, counting sheep \nwe will fall into sleep \nand we awake to a new day of living \nand loving you so. \n\nAlive And Well And Living In\n\nNobody sees her here, her eyes are slowly closing. \nIf she should want some peace, she sits there, without moving, \nand puts a pillow over the phone. \nAnd if she feels like dancing no one will know it. \nGiving herself a chance there's no need to show her how it should be. \nShe can't remember now when she was all in pieces. \nShe's quite content to sit there listening to what he says. \nHow he didn't like to be alone. \nAnd if he feels like crying she's there to hear him. \nNo reason to complain and nothing to fear, they always will be... \n\nJust Trying To Be\n\nThere was a time when you were so young and walked in their way. \nThey made you feel they loved you all-seeing they say. \nYou're going wrong if their game you don't play \nAnd that the song I sing will leave you astray. \nUnfeeling, feel lonely rejection, \nunknowing, know you're going wrong. \nAnd they can't see that we're just trying to be, \nand not what we seem, \nand even now believe that it's not real and only a dream. \n\nBy Kind Permission Of\n\n[Introduction:] \nPlease, let's have a big welcome for Jethro Tull. \nWhoop! \nHello. Hang on, press on. Be back with you in a minute. \nI'd better not open this now because it might contain contraband. \nWe'll give it to John to supplement his camels. He dropped on his \nhead when he was very small. We occasionally cut his fingernails off \nand smoke them. This is a... a song about... about everything. \n\nDharma For One\n\n[Introduction:] \nShe's really turned on by the television, and vice versa. \nHere's a song called, [???]. Yes, right. Rearranged though, \nnevertheless. A new lease on life. In other words, it's just a bit \nlouder. ``Dharma For One''. \n[Lyrics:] \nDharma, seek and you will find \ntruth within your mind, Dharma. \n\nDharma, each to his own we say, \ntogether we'll end astray, Dharma. \n\nTruth is like freedom, it doesn't fool me. \nBe true to yourself, never think that you're free. \nDharma will come eventually. \n\n[Outtroduction:] \nThank you! [???] \n\nWond'ring Again\n\nThere's the stillness of death on a deathly unliving sea, \nand the motor car magical world long since ceased to be, \nwhen the Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree. \nIncestuous ancestry's charabanc ride, \nspawning new millions throws the world on its side. \nSupporting their far-flung illusion, the national curse, \nand those with no sandwiches please get off the bus. \n\nThe excrement bubbles, \nthe century's slime decays \nand the brainwashing government lackeys \nwould have us say \nit's under control and we'll soon be on our way \nto a grand year for babies and quiz panel games \nof the hot hungry millions you'll be sure to remain. \n\nThe natural resources are dwindling and no one grows old, \nand those with no homes to go to, please dig yourself holes. \n\nWe wandered through quiet lands, felt the first breath of snow. \nSearched for the last pigeon, slate grey I've been told. \nStumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush, heard it sigh, \nand left it to die. \nAt once felt remorse and were touched by the loss of our own, \nheld its poor broken head in her hands, \ndropped soft tears in the snow, \nand it's only the taking that makes you what you are. \n\nWond'ring aloud will a son one day be born \nto share in our infancy \nin the child's path we've worn. \nIn the aging seclusion of this earth that our birth did surprise \nwe'll open his eyes. \n\nHymn 43\n\nOh father high in heaven -- smile down upon your son \nwhose busy with his money games -- his women and his gun. \nOh Jesus save me! \nAnd the unsung Western hero killed an Indian or three \nand made his name in Hollywood \nto set the white man free. \nOh Jesus save me! \nIf Jesus saves -- well, He'd better save Himself \nfrom the gory glory seekers who use His name in death. \nOh Jesus save me! \nI saw him in the city and on the mountains of the moon -- \nHis cross was rather bloody -- \nHe could hardly roll His stone. \nOh Jesus save me! \n\nLife Is A Long Song\n\nWhen you're falling awake and you take stock of the new day, \nand you hear your voice croak as you choke on what you need to say, \nwell, don't you fret, don't you fear, \nI will give you good cheer. \nLife's a long song. \nLife's a long song. \nLife's a long song. \n\nIf you wait then your plate I will fill. \n\nAs the verses unfold and your soul suffers the long day, \nand the twelve o'clock gloom spins the room, \nyou struggle on your way. \nWell, don't you sigh, don't you cry, \nlick the dust from your eye. \n\nLife's a long song. \nLife's a long song. \nLife's a long song. \n\nWe will meet in the sweet light of dawn. \n\nAs the Baker Street train spills your pain all over your new dress, \nand the symphony sounds underground put you under duress, \nwell don't you squeal as the heel grinds you under the wheel. \n\nLife's a long song. \nLife's a long song. \nLife's a long song. \n\nBut the tune ends too soon for us all. \n\nUp The `Pool\n\nI'm going up the `pool from down the smoke below \nto taste my mum's jam sarnies and see our Aunty Flo. \nThe candyfloss salesman watches ladies in the sand \ndown for a freaky weekend in the hope that they'll be meeting \nMister Universe. \nThe iron tower smiles down upon the silver sea \nand along the golden mile they'll be swigging mugs of tea. \nThe politicians there who've come to take the air \nwhile posing for the daily press \nwill look around and blame the mess \non Edward Bear. \n\nThere'll be bucket, spades and bingo, cockles, mussels, rainy days, \nseaweed and sand castles, icy waves. \nDeck chairs, rubber dinghies, old vests, braces dangling down, \nsun-tanned stranded starfish in a daze. \n\nWe're going up the `pool from down the smoke below \nto taste my mum's jam sarnies and see our Aunty Flo. \nThe candy floss salesman watches ladies in the sand \ndown for a freaky weekend in the hope that they'll be meeting \nMister Universe. \n\nThere'll be buckets, spades and bingo, cockles, mussels, rainy days, \nseaweed and sand castles, icy waves, \nDeck chairs, rubber dinghies, old vests, braces dangling down, \nsun-tanned stranded starfish in a daze. \n\nOh Blackpool, \noh Blackpool. \n\nDr. Bogenbroom\n\nI have one foot in the graveyard and the other on the bus, \nand the passengers do trample each other in the rush. \nAnd the chicken hearted lawman is throwing up his fill \nto see the kindly doctor to pass the super pill. \nWell, I'm going down, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom. \nWell, I'm on my way, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom. \nWell I've tried my best to love you all, \nall you hypocrites and whores, \nwith your eyes on each other and the locks upon your doors. \nWell you drowned me in the fountain of life and I hated you \nfor living while I was dying, we were all just passing through. \nWell, I'm going down, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom. \nWell, I'm on my way, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom. \n\nFor Later\n\n[Instrumental] \n\nNursie\n\nTip-toes in silence `round my bed \nand quiets the raindrops overhead. \nWith her everlasting smile \nShe still my fever for a while. \nOh, nursie dear, \nI'm glad you're here \nto brush away my pain.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56cfb1e0c8cd5a8a2269dda4e7f4b0f5deedd461","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Living+In+The+Past+-+1972+%282004+Remasters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56cfb1e0c8cd5a8a2269dda4e7f4b0f5deedd461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,207,177,224,200,205,90,138,34,105,221,164,231,244,176,245,222,237,212,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
