Enlisting as a private, he rose to command armies at the height of the Revolution, in an audacious campaign across Europe and the Middle East Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until he met an implacable enemy he could not defeat.\n\nThe Black Count is simultaneously a riveting adventure story, a lushly textured evocation of 18th-century France, and a window into the modern worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first multi-racial society. But it is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5f259976d63a47bcaea1b48de3dff7534f77d6","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+unabridged+of+The+Black+Count+by+Tom+Reiss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5f259976d63a47bcaea1b48de3dff7534f77d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,95,37,153,118,214,58,71,188,174,161,180,141,227,223,247,83,79,119,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
