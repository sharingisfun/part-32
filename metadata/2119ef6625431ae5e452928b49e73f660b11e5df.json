There is nothing wrong with the old rip. I made this for people who stress out about EAC logs and CUEs and such. I have gotten a whole lot of great music from people who stress out about such things.\n\nThe other new thing about this torrent is that it contains booklet scans. If you already have this astounding 3 CD set and don't care about EAC logs and such, you may want to just download the scans.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nThe recordings on EARL HINES PLAYS DUKE ELLINGTON come from a series of four LPs that Earl Hines recorded for the Master Jazz label in four separate sessions between 1971 and 1975. EARL HINES PLAYS DUKE ELLINGTON contains all of the Hines performances of Ellington tunes included in the four original Master Jazz LPs.\n\nThese are solo piano performances.\n\n1998 New World Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2119ef6625431ae5e452928b49e73f660b11e5df","amp;dn":"Earl+Hines+Plays+Duke+Ellington+%281971-75%29+new+rip+%2B+scans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2119ef6625431ae5e452928b49e73f660b11e5df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,25,239,102,37,67,26,229,228,82,146,139,73,231,63,102,11,17,229,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
