(Method of Destruction) is a crossover thrash band from New York City, fronted by Stormtroopers of Death vocalist Billy Milano. The band has been around for 30 years (minus one hiatus from 1997 to 2001), and released eight studio albums. With M.O.D., Milano sought to continue on the musical path of the bands Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Nuclear Assault, mixing shades of hardcore punk with thrash metal and often humorous and politically incorrect lyrics.\r\nU.S.A. for M.O.D., the band's debut album, was produced by S.O.D. bandmate and Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian. The first track, &quot;Aren't You Hungry?&quot;, a reworking of an S.O.D. song, is noted for the lyric &quot;fuck those niggers' charity,&quot; referring to the then-common famine relief activism such as We Are the World.\r\n\r\nM.O.D.'s second effort, Surfin' M.O.D., was an anomaly, featuring little thrash metal, focusing more on humorous cover songs and a beach party atmosphere. The band would return to their roots on Gross Misconduct, as well as further expand their sound on Rhythm of Fear. It was around this time that Milano performed a reunion show with S.O.D. at The Ritz in New York.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Milano reformed M.O.D. with a new lineup, and two years later, released The Rebel You Love to Hate, somewhat of a return to Milano's humorous past with jabs at white suburban rap fans and the War on Terrorism. M.O.D. relocated to Austin, Texas, and released the album Red, White &amp; Screwed in October 2007 through Index Entertainment, and launched a supporting tour in summer 2008. The band played its final touring show in the United States on September 13, 2008, however the band still performs periodically (mostly in Austin, TX, where Billy currently resides).\r\n\r\nIn May 2013, Milano announced a 25th Anniversary Tour dubbed &quot;The Mexicans On Duty Tour&quot; featuring the band's new lineup. \r\n\r\nM.O.D. is currently working on a new album, titled Busted, Broke and American. In 2014, they offered a free download of their first song in seven years &quot;Hermano&quot;. In May 2015, the group disbanded due to Billy Milano wanting to focus on his private life. All tours and album plans were cancelled as a result. A month later, however, Milano announced that M.O.D. is still together and they plan to finish their new album Busted, Broke and American, and tour in 2016 in support of it. \r\nAnd now in 2016 we wait to see if its gonna happen or not but until then here is what they got.\r\n\r\nMethod Of Destruction Discography 1987-2007\r\n\r\n1987 \tU.S.A. for M.O.D. \tMegaforce Records \t\r\n\r\n1988 \tSurfin' M.O.D. \t\r\n\r\n1989 \tGross Misconduct \t\r\n\r\n1992 \tRhythm of Fear \t\r\n\r\n1994 \tDevolution \tMusic For Nations \t\r\n\r\n1995 \tLoved by Thousands, Hated by Millions \tMegaforce Records \t\r\n\r\n1996   \tDictated Aggression \tMusic For Nations \t\r\n\r\n2003 \tThe Rebel You Love to Hate \tNuclear Blast Records \t\r\n\r\n2007 \tRed, White &amp; Screwed \r\n\r\n\r\nWho they are/were\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Billy Milano â€“ Vocals\r\n    Scott Sargeant - Bass Guitar\r\n    Michael Arellano â€“ Drums\r\n    Mike Deleon - Guitar\r\n\r\nPrevious members\r\n\r\n    Tim McMurtrie â€“ guitar\r\n    Louis Svitek â€“ guitar\r\n    Tommy Klimchuck â€“ guitar\r\n    John Pereksta â€“ guitar, bass\r\n    Joe Young â€“ guitar\r\n    Joe Affe - guitar\r\n    Bernard Langendorf - guitar\r\n    Ken Ballone â€“ bass\r\n    Jeff Wood - bass\r\n    Jake Landrau - bass\r\n    John Monte â€“ bass\r\n    Rob Moschetti â€“ bass\r\n    Chris &quot;Dawson Clawson&quot; Dawson - bass, vocals\r\n    Tim Casterline - bass\r\n    David &quot;Ziggy&quot; Reinhardt - drums\r\n    Keith Davis â€“ drums\r\n    Tim Mallare â€“ drums\r\n    Dave Chavarri â€“ drums\r\n    Tony Scaglione - drums\r\n    Darren Verpeut â€“ drums\r\n    Danny &quot;DNA&quot; Burkhardt â€“ drums\r\n    Derek &quot;Lennon&quot; Lopez - drums\r\n\r\nWhat we may or may not get:\r\n\r\n2016 \tBusted, Broke and American \t(expected release)\r\n\r\nEnjoy and share with others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e37118eeaf89e511be5dcbb6a8964ae0027acdb","amp;dn":"M.O.D.+Discography+1987-2007+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e37118eeaf89e511be5dcbb6a8964ae0027acdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,55,17,142,234,248,158,81,27,229,220,187,106,137,100,174,0,39,172,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
