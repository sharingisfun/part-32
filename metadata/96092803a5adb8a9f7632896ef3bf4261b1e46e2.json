Carlile's translation of RIMBAUD:THE WORKS. \n\n&quot;These are the best renditions of Rimbaud in English since Wallace Fowlie's nearly forty years ago, and many of them surpass that high standard. These poems have been wrestled with, which is the very least they demand, and successfully brought back home. Carlile gets the difficult switches and swoops of tone mostly right, and the linguistic detail is impressive-- for 'un voix etraignait mon coeur gele' you can't get much better than 'a voice would hobble my frostbitten heart'.&quot; \n\nThis new translation of Rimbaud is the first in English to include the fragments and a &quot;Found Poem&quot; in English. Notes and commentary along with a life-chronology and &quot;selected further media&quot; assist the reader in delving into these darkly brilliant visions.\n\nRIMBAUD: THE WORKS is the first new English version of this poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work in 25 years. It contains all of his extant work from 1869 to 1875.\n\nThe book is laid out in four parts. PART ONE contains &quot;A Season In Hell&quot; (1873) along with Delmore SchwartzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perceptive introduction (out of print for over half a century). PART TWO contains all the poetry and prose pieces composed between 1869 and 1875, including THE DRUNKEN BOAT, the &quot;Album Zutique&quot; and the fragments called Ã¢â‚¬Å“BribesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ first published by Gallimard in 1954. PART THREE consists of &quot;Illuminations&quot; (c. 1872Ã¢â‚¬â€œ74) with a brief preface culled from Enid StarkieÃ‚Â´s ARTHUR RIMBAUD. &quot;Illuminations&quot; is lineated according to the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manuscript (published in facsimile with facing print text by Editions BibliothÃƒÂ¨que de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Image 1998) and the order of the text is that of the manuscript.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96092803a5adb8a9f7632896ef3bf4261b1e46e2","amp;dn":"Rimbaud%3A+The+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96092803a5adb8a9f7632896ef3bf4261b1e46e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,9,40,3,165,173,184,169,247,99,40,150,239,59,244,38,27,30,70,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
