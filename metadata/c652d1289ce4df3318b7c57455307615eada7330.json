Painting, bark art, photography, rock art, sculpture, and the decorative arts are all fully explored to present the rich texture of Australian art traditions. Well-known artists such as Margaret Preston, Rover Thomas to Sidney Nolan, are all discussed, as are the natural history illustrators, Aboriginal draughtsmen, and pastellists, whose work is only now being brought to light by new research. Taking the European colonization of the continent in 1788 as his starting point, Sayers highlights important issues concerning colonial art and women artists in this fascinating new story of Australian art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c652d1289ce4df3318b7c57455307615eada7330","amp;dn":"Australian+Art+%28Oxford+History+of+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c652d1289ce4df3318b7c57455307615eada7330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,82,209,40,156,228,223,51,24,183,197,116,85,48,118,21,234,218,115,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
