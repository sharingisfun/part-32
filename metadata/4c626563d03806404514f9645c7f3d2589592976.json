T. Hamlin, who wrote and drew the popular and influential strip through four decades for Newspaper Enterprise Association. Hamlin introduced an engaging cast of characters, and his storylines entertained with a combination of adventure, fantasy and humor.\nAlley Oop, the strip's title character, was a sturdy citizen in the prehistoric kingdom of Moo. He rode his pet dinosaur, Dinny, carried a stone war hammer and wore nothing but a fur loincloth. He would rather fight dinosaurs in the jungle than deal with his fellow countrymen in Moo's capital (and only) cave-town. In spite of these exotic settings, the stories were often satires of American suburban life.\n\n\ncbr format read in cddisplay or comicrack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c626563d03806404514f9645c7f3d2589592976","amp;dn":"Alley+Oop+%281996-2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c626563d03806404514f9645c7f3d2589592976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,98,101,99,208,56,6,64,69,20,249,100,92,127,61,37,137,89,41,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
