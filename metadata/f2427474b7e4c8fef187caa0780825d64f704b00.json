He stroked one eyebrow in a satisfied way. &quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoroughly despicable.&quot; &quot;Lovely,&quot; said his wife. &quot;A plan for what?&quot; &quot;To rid us of the children.&quot; Little do Mr. And Mrs. Willoughby know that while they are trying to rid themselves of their children, the childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€four of themÃ¢â‚¬â€are trying to rid themselves of their terrible parents. This is a humorous book, of course, and no one is recommending that real children do away with their parents. (Unless, of courseÃ¢â‚¬â€heh hehÃ¢â‚¬â€their parents are as outrageously awful as Mr. And Mrs. Willoughby!)\n\nVisit us at - www.lfrg.co.vu (currently under construction, but feel free to visit, and make sure you leave feedback for us)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2427474b7e4c8fef187caa0780825d64f704b00","amp;dn":"Lois+Lowry-The+Willoughbys+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2427474b7e4c8fef187caa0780825d64f704b00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,66,116,116,183,228,200,254,241,135,202,160,120,8,37,214,79,112,75,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
