Trouble is, the recordÃ¢â‚¬â€œbuying public doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always know which BBC band is going to show up. Another recent release, The Gleneagles, directed by Barrie Forgie, was disappointing to those of us whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d prefer more Jazz and less schmaltz; Evidence, directed by trombonist Jiggs Whigham, finds the band in a more adventurous frame of mind, saluting hardÃ¢â‚¬â€œcore Jazz enthusiasts by storming earnestly through a seductive program of luminous standards, splendid original works by Francy Boland, Paul Ferguson, John Clayton and Petri Juutilainen and swinging charts by Clayton, Vaughn Wiester, Mike Barone, Rick Wilkins and Manny Albam. Not satisfied merely to conduct, Whigham unlimbers his agile trombone to good effect on WiesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrangement of JobimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dindi,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ JuutilainenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lester Went Out,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ WilkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ definitive treatment of Ray NobleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Touch of Your Lips,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ FergusonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues for Clare,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shout Me OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and AlbamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrangement of Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Be So Nice to Come Home To.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When not soloing, Whigham makes sure that every i is dotted and every t is crossed, and the ensemble responds with a letterÃ¢â‚¬â€œperfect performance that presses home the richness and vitality of every number. After opening with ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lively take on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deed I DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (solos by trumpeter Mark White, flugel Paul Eshelby, tenor Martin Williams), the band slows the pace for Ã¢â‚¬Å“DindiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and BaroneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comeÃ¢â‚¬â€œhither arrangement of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes Sir, ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Andy Panayi, alto; Roy Babbington, bass). Drummer Harold Fisher, once the driving force behind Jack SharpeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excellent big band, assumes the same role here, kicking the band hard when necessary and playing with elegance and restraint when that is called for (as on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Touch of Your Lips,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose handsome solos are by Whigham and Williams). Williams returns with pianist Andy Vinter on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thou Swell,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ trombonist Gordon Campbell is showcased on BolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lovely Ã¢â‚¬Å“Clair Obscur,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and vibraphonist Anthony Kerr shares center stage with trumpeters White, John Ruddick and Nigel Carter on ClaytonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrangement of Thelonious MonkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skittish Ã¢â‚¬Å“Evidence.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Whigham and alto Howard McGill are the soloists on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues for Clare,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Whigham, McGill and Kerr on the bluesy finale, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shout Me Out.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been searching for a crisp and dynamic recording by the BBC Big BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Team,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you need look no further. Here it is.
