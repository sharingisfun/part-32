Yet among the last of the non-detuned hardware synths available to man, Daniel Savio remains restless and full of artistic zeal. From the sometimes-open window of his studio apartment in Stockholm, a humming and hissing sound brings the promise of spring. Indoors, the air lies thick with sequences reminiscent of turn of the century Flipmode Squad and some of the coldest waves to ever have spread from the Arctic Circle. All from the mind of what his management team and label still consider the third original member of Kraftwerk.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Ignition Sequence  (01:10), 2.70 MB\n02.
