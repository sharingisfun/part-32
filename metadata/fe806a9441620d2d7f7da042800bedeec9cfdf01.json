This user-friendly house building \r\nsoftware will have beginning home designers drawing custom floor plans within the \r\nhour and yet has all the tools to keep advanced users satisfied.\r\n\r\nThis house plan software can help plan your home remodel with real-life \r\napplications, such as a cost estimator and electrical and plumbing planning tools \r\nthat are essential for your planning.\r\n\r\nOverall Utility\r\n\r\nThis is one of the easiest-to-use home remodeling software products that we \r\nreviewed. Drawing a floor plan from scratch is easy with the QuickStart menu. With \r\nQuickStart, rooms are labeled and color-coded for you above your blank floor plan. \r\nAs you add rooms to your custom floor plan, a 3D model will automatically generate.\r\n\r\nIf you want to furnish your custom floor plan quickly, there are editable room \r\ntemplates that you can drag and drop into empty rooms. The editable room templates \r\ninclude finished kitchens, bedrooms, living areas and more. These room templates can\r\nhelp give you ideas on how to style each room. The templates are editable, so you \r\ncan change any details that you donâ€™t like.\r\n\r\nNavigating through your 3D model isnâ€™t difficult with TurboFloorPlan Pro. The \r\ntaskbar atop your screen is clear and concise when navigating between 2D and 3D \r\nviews. You can choose to walkthrough your 3D home, take an aerial tour or view your \r\nentire 3D model layout from above without the roof, also called a dollhouse view. \r\nAll of these views are easy to select and control.\r\n\r\nInterior Design &amp; Kitchen\r\n\r\nWhile looking at your 2D floor plan, you will notice a list of tabs at the top of \r\nyour window. You can get as detailed as you want with your floor plan by adding \r\nelectrical, plumbing, HVAC and more. These tools, along with the cost estimator, \r\nbecome quintessential for real-life remodeling, helping you plan and budget your \r\nremodel before you attempt the real thing.\r\n\r\nOne construction quality this program has that few other home design software \r\nproducts have is the ability to curve walls. Curved walls are a great way to add \r\nunique character to your home. You can also add plenty of character to your property\r\nby changing the topography of your property. You can add hills, valleys and much \r\nmore. To put the finishing touches on your yard, there is a fencing tool, which you \r\ncan use to customize and add the final touches to your yard.\r\n\r\nConstruction &amp; Landscaping\r\n\r\nThe plant library alone offers thousands of different trees, shrubs, flowers and \r\nother plant life to facilitate your yard. With the topography tools and this large \r\nplant library, you can design the yard that youâ€™ve always wanted.\r\n\r\nThe object library offers thousands of options and combinations of both indoor and \r\noutdoor furniture, appliances, flooring, light fixtures and more. There are hundreds\r\nof cabinet combinations to choose from that match any decorative style.\r\n\r\nWhen you add anything from the object library, you first have to add them to your 2D\r\nplan. We were unable to drag and drop objects from the object library straight to \r\nthe 3D model. Other software we reviewed allows you to do both, so you donâ€™t have to\r\nkeep toggling between 2D and 3D views.\r\n\r\nHelp &amp; Support\r\n\r\nThere are many video tutorials online and an in-program manual, which you can use to\r\nhelp you start using TurboFloorPlan Pro. If you encounter any problems with your \r\nsoftware, you can contact IMSI Design via email and telephone.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nTurboFloorPlan Home and Landscaping Pro is one of the easiest home design programs \r\nto use that we reviewed. It offers many tools to help you plan your home renovation \r\nincluding cost estimators and electrical and plumbing planners. Whether you are a \r\nbeginner or advanced user of house planning software, TurboFloorPlan Pro can help \r\nyou plan a redesign of your home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe806a9441620d2d7f7da042800bedeec9cfdf01","amp;dn":"IMSI+TurboFloorPlan+2016+Pro+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe806a9441620d2d7f7da042800bedeec9cfdf01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,128,106,148,65,98,13,45,127,125,160,66,128,11,237,238,201,207,223,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
