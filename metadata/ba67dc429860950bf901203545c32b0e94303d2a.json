But thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even more to it than that. Birds are remarkable for a wide range of exceptional physical abilities, for their indications of intelligence, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for some species ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ their surprising level of rapport with humans.\n\nIn the small Indian village of Kundha Kulam, for example, birdsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ arrival are a sign to the townspeople that rain will follow and that their crops would soon thrive. While falconry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the art of training hawks, falcons and other birds of prey to hunt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ exemplifies the partnership men and birds can develop.\n\nHumans have also relied on the more prosaic pigeon. Although city dwellers may dismiss them as flying rats, no bird can top the pigeon for courage and service to humankind. Since pigeons have the ability to find their way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhome,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ many were used in dangerous, top-secret missions in World War I and II, delivering important messages to Allied troops behind enemy lines.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATED BY: Diana Cardea\n-------------------------\n\n\nYear:  2000\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:53:57\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 592x448\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1771 kbit/s\nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174871/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1174871/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba67dc429860950bf901203545c32b0e94303d2a","amp;dn":"Extraordinary+Birds-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba67dc429860950bf901203545c32b0e94303d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,103,220,66,152,96,149,11,249,1,32,53,69,195,43,14,148,48,61,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
