Today, its lovely white stuccoed buildings remind us of its opulent past. A horse and carriage ride down the Paseo Montejo will help you understand why Merida was once known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Paris of Mexico.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Rick takes us on a journey through the Merida market stalls for a look at the blending of Mayan traditions with the Spanish influences. Dishes such as Sikil Pak, a pumpkinseed dip with habanero is totally Mayan, yet still part of MeridaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meals today. The marketÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meat stalls jump-start RickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surprising roller coaster ride through MeridaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s food history from simple pork Picadillo to the baroque Queso Relleno (stuffed cheese) found in all the classic Yucatan restaurants. Along the way, we explore the Lebanese influence on this colonial city where thousands of locals dance in the town square nearly every night of the week.
