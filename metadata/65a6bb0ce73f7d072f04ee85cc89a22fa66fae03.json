Set on the Orient Express, \ntraveling from Ostend to Constantinople, the story features a varied \ncast, including a wealthy Jewish merchant, a chorus girl, a burglar \nturned murderer, an exiled nationalist/revolutionary, and assorted other \npassengers. Michael Maloney manages the multinational voices, effectively \nconveying the wide range of emotions in this tale on intrigue and subterfuge. \nThe reading keeps the listener focused on what will happen next. An \nexcellent performance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a6bb0ce73f7d072f04ee85cc89a22fa66fae03","amp;dn":"Graham+Greene+-+Stamboul+Train","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a6bb0ce73f7d072f04ee85cc89a22fa66fae03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,166,187,12,231,63,125,7,47,4,238,133,204,137,162,47,166,111,174,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
