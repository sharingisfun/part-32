The exhibition presented 650 works of art, confiscated from German museums, and was staged in counterpoint to the concurrent Great German Art Exhibition. The day before the exhibition started, Hitler delivered a speech declaring &quot;merciless war&quot; on cultural disintegration, attacking &quot;chatterboxes, dilettantes and art swindlers&quot;. Degenerate art was defined as works that &quot;insult German feeling, or destroy or confuse natural form or simply reveal an absence of adequate manual and artistic skill&quot;. One million people attended the exhibition in its first six weeks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:359822e58679277caee721508f7dad4d6e6a9523","amp;dn":"Degenerate+Art%2C+Nazi+Exhibition+1937+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"359822e58679277caee721508f7dad4d6e6a9523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,152,34,229,134,121,39,124,174,231,33,80,143,125,173,77,110,106,149,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
