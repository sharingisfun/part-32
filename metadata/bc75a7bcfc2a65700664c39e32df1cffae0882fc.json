Inspired by The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and based in a brutal world of tyrants, it details the perilous quest of Jebel, the thin son of a respected executioner, to petition a fire god for invincibility and succeed his father.\n\nJebel Rum is a thin, scrawny boy. His father is the famed executioner in the city where they live. When Jebel is humiliated in public, he sets off on a quest to gain great strength and invincibility. If successful, he will be able to compete in a gruelling contest to prove himself and replace his father as the wielder of the axe. Failure, on the other hands, means certain death.\n\nTo win the favour of a fire god, Jebel must make a human sacrifice. He finds a slave who is willing to pay this grisly price, and the pair set off on a trek through lands deadly and unwelcoming. In the course of their travels they will encounter hatred, bigotry, slavery, death and a whole lot more. It is the nightmarish adventure of a lifetimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Shan has often stated that this is his favorite out of all of the books he has written over the years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc75a7bcfc2a65700664c39e32df1cffae0882fc","amp;dn":"Darren+Shan+-The+Thin+Executioner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc75a7bcfc2a65700664c39e32df1cffae0882fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,117,167,188,252,42,101,112,6,100,195,158,50,223,28,255,174,8,130,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
