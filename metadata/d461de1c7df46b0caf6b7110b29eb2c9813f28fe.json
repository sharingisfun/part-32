For decades, government pundits have dismissed these &quot;coincidental&quot; deaths, even regarding them as &quot;myths&quot; as &quot;urban legends.&quot;\n\nLike most people, Richard and David were initially unsure about what to make of these &quot;coincidences&quot;. After all, events donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t &quot;consult the odds&quot; prior to happening; they simply happen. Then someone comes along later and figures out what the odds of it happening were. Some of the deaths seemed purely coincidental; heart attacks, hunting accidents. Others clearly seemed noteworthy; witnesses who did seem to know something and did seem to die mysteriously.\n\nHit List is a fair examination of the evidence of each case, leading to (necessarily) different conclusions. The findings were absolutely staggering; as some cases were clearly linked to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“clean-up operationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ after the murder of President Kennedy, while others were the result of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœother forcesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The impeccable research and writing of Richard Belzer and David Wayne show that if the government is trying to hide anything, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the duo who will uncover it. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hit-List-Investigation-Assassination-ebook/dp/B00C7XDYGU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373506376&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=hit+list&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hit-List-Investigation-Assassination-ebook/dp/B00C7XDYGU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373506376&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=hit+list&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d461de1c7df46b0caf6b7110b29eb2c9813f28fe","amp;dn":"Hit+List%3A+An+In-Depth+Investigation+into+the+Mysterious+Deaths+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d461de1c7df46b0caf6b7110b29eb2c9813f28fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,97,222,28,125,244,107,12,175,107,113,16,178,158,178,201,129,63,40,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
