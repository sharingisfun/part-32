Because any complex network can be represented by a graph, and therefore in turn by a matrix, graph theory has become a powerful tool in the investigation of network performance.\n\nThis self-contained book provides a concise introduction to the theory of graph spectra and its applications to the study of complex networks. Covering a range of types of graphs and topics important to the analysis of complex systems, this guide provides the mathematical foundation needed to understand and apply spectral insight to real-world systems.\n\nIn particular, the general properties of both the adjacency and Laplacian spectrum of graphs are derived and applied to complex networks. An ideal resource for researchers and students in communications networking as well as in physics and mathematics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb7f3b2a31edbfcce8351a8bddcfd8f86e09c08c","amp;dn":"Graph+Spectra+For+Complex+Networks+2011+By+Piet+Van+Mieghem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb7f3b2a31edbfcce8351a8bddcfd8f86e09c08c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,127,59,42,49,237,191,204,232,53,26,139,221,207,216,248,110,9,192,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
