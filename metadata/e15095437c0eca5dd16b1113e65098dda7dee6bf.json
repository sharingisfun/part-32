We set up live in a 24-track studio and the original 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds all boxed in. Since it was our first record, we really didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what we were doing. I think the songs are OK, but the sound quality should have been much better for what it was. The re-release of that on C/Z was actually a different recording. We recorded the songs twice because on the first one, the vocals were a little bit distorted, a little bit too hot, and our bass player (Matt Lukin of Mudhoney) had only changed one string on his bass, so this one string was really bright and the others were dead. We went back in the studio and did them again and put the second (session) out. When we listened back to the first one a long time later, we just thought it sounded way better, so when they re-issued it (on C/Z) we had them put that one out.&quot; So theres that melvins 10 songs get it........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15095437c0eca5dd16b1113e65098dda7dee6bf","amp;dn":"Melvins+-+10+Songs++EP+192k+++mp3+++ak%2C2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15095437c0eca5dd16b1113e65098dda7dee6bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,80,149,67,124,14,202,93,209,107,17,19,230,80,152,221,167,222,230,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
