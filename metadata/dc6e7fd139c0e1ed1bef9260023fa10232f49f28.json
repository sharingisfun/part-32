Larger Than Life This is a great song...if you are a fan of the Boys. \nIf you aren't skip it. Or if you aren't a big fan but dig the beat, \nthen buy the single version (it has the instrumental version). \nBut I have to say, as a fan of theirs it's nice to have five guys sing a song for me. \nAnd the 11 other million girls out there. And 15 guys. And 36 adults.\n\n02. I Want It That Way This track, by far, is the best on the album. \nBy that, I mean that if all the people in the world had to agree on one track\noff the album as their favorite, this would be it. The music is perfect not a ballad, \nbut not too fast-paced either. The lyrics are even better. \nIf you haven't hear it (yeah right!), the Boys are singing about a relationship \nthat just isn't working out.\nAnd it is not confusing, contrary to what E. Weekly and R. \nStone say. But for those slow-witted critics, \nhere's a quick explanation: &quot;You are my fire, the one desire...&quot; \nThe first lines are obvious in their meaning. &quot;But we are two worlds apart...&quot; \nI'm sure we've all felt that way before. Now for the somewhat strange chorus. \n&quot;Tell me why?/Ain't nothin' but a heartache/Tell me why?/Ain't nothin' but a mistake...\n&quot; What that means is, I think, that we're asking our (ex)partner why it isn't working out. \nAnd the reply is...well, just listen. Then---&quot;Am I your fire? Your one desire? Yes I know, it's too late...\n&quot; So say you put yourself on the line by syaing that ---is your fire, etc.\nSo you want to know how they feel before you write them out of your life forever. \nThen there's that part &quot;now I can see that we've fallen apart...no matter \nthe distance I want you to know...you are my fire, the one desire...\n&quot; And the song goes on from there. See? Not so hard to comprehed.\n\n03. Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely This is basically a very sad song about being lonely. \nKudos to Max Martin and the late Herbert Crichlow for a great song, \ndespite some confusing lyrics here and there. The Boys voices really shine here. \nAs they do in I Want It That Way.\n\n04. It's Gotta Be You I suppose they had to include some pop-flavor. \nThink Backstreet's Back, I Want You Back, and funky lyrics mixed up together, and you have the song.\n\n05. I Need You Tonight A great song, produced and written by Shania Twain's hubby, \nand sung by Nick Carter, the Boys with the famed high-pitched voice. \nBut he does alright here, and the piano sounds even better.\n\n06. Don't Want You Back This is a tribute to all ex-girlfriends and those who used the \nBoys because they were famous/rich. An awesome track, \nand will probably be released in the summer of '00.\n\n07. Don't Wanna Lose You Now. A nice, sad, love song.\n\n08. The One A nice, spacey, but somehow dance/rock beat. \nThe chorus may sound a bit egotisitical, but the the Boys pass it off with their \nvoices as being somehow endearing.\n\n09. Back To your Heart A beautiful love song, cowritten by one of the Boys. \nYou want her back? Forget NSYNC, just play this.\n\n10. Spanish Eyes Also kind of confusing, but a nice ballad.\n\n11. No One Else Comes Close This is a truly wonderful ballad, \nperfect for married couples. Trust me.\n\n12. The Perfect Fan The Boys love their girls (fans), \nbut mama come's first. This is a perfect ending. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-1121358953/backstreet_boys_larger_than_life_official_music_video/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metacafe.com/watch/sy-1121358953/backstreet_boys_larger_than_life_official_music_video/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc6e7fd139c0e1ed1bef9260023fa10232f49f28","amp;dn":"Backstreet+Boys+Millennium+2011+Remastered+%26+Art+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc6e7fd139c0e1ed1bef9260023fa10232f49f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,110,127,209,57,192,225,237,27,239,146,96,2,63,161,2,50,244,159,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
