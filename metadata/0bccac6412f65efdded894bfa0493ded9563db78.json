Exactly in the middle the track seems to stop, as if it was\nlooking around for its possibilities. Introspections, McPheeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only\ncontribution on pocket trumpet, a harsh BrÃƒÂ¶tzmann-like outburst and McPhee\nhumming are the result.\n\nLately McPheeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music has been less motivated by the political situation of\nAfrican-Americans but more by the sonic exploration of his instruments (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sonic\nElementsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) but on this album it seems that he wanted to comment on recent\nsocial upheavals again. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love in the Time of AIDSÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ just asks what love is today\nopposed to sex, power and control. On the one hand it is an incredibly sad\ncomment on a feeling that seems to vanish, the piece sounds like a\nrequiem. However, it is also a great musical reminiscence to John Coltrane,\nAlbert Ayler and Pharoah Sanders.\n\nThe final track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Song for BeggarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is the most obvious political statement\nstarting with the words Ã¢â‚¬Å“This song wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feed the starving, nor will\nconferences on hunger with a fortune spent on talking. Nor will it house the\nhomeless or quench the thirst of millions who will die from lack of water while\nthe vampires drink their bloodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ words clearly in the tradition of beat\ngeneration authors like Amiri Baraka (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nation TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a tribute to him). It\nis a dark piece, full of frenzy, yet it is also elegant, beautifully swinging,\nenrooted in gospel and blues.\n\nAnother great album of a great artist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bccac6412f65efdded894bfa0493ded9563db78","amp;dn":"Survival+Unit+III+-+Game+Theory+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bccac6412f65efdded894bfa0493ded9563db78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,204,172,100,18,246,94,253,222,216,148,191,160,73,61,237,149,99,219,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
