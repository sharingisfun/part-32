Wearing a saddle.... But worse than this was when the proprietor exclaimed to a cheering crowd, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We are taking the dinosaurs back from the evolutionists!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He knew then and there it was time to try and salvage the Land of the Enlightened, buried somewhere in this new Home of the Uninformed. \n\nWith his razor-sharp wit and erudite reasoning, Pierce delivers a gut-wrenching, side-splitting lament about the glorification of ignorance in the United States, and how a country founded on intellectual curiosity has somehow deteriorated into a nation of simpletons more apt to vote for an American Idol contestant than a presidential candidate. \n\nWith Idiot America, Pierce's thunderous denunciation is also a secret call to action, as he hopes that somehow, being intelligent will stop being a stigma, and that pinheads will once again be pitied, not celebrated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15e22220f02dd8fe75de335cd2b7491351d20fb6","amp;dn":"Idiot+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15e22220f02dd8fe75de335cd2b7491351d20fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,226,34,32,240,45,216,254,117,222,51,92,210,183,73,19,81,210,15,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
