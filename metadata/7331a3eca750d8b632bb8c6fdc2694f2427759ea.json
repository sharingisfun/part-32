Recorded in autumn 1961, Royal Flush is hard-swinging (with the baritone sax of Pepper Adams, how could it not be?) and deep-grooving hard bop. It does, however, point to aspects of jazz's future--note the poignant &quot;Requiem,&quot; contributed by a young Herbie Hancock (this session's pianist) and the inventive drumming of Billy Higgins.\n\nTracklist\n[color=deepskyblue]1.Hush\n2.I'm a Fool to Want You\n3.Jorgie's\n4.Shangri-La\n5.6 M's\n6.Requiem\n\n\nRecording information: Van Gelder Studios, Englewood Cliffs, NJ (09/21/1961)\n\nPersonnel:\nDonald Byrd (trumpet); Donald Byrd; Butch Warren (upright bass); Pepper Adams (baritone saxophone); Herbie Hancock (piano); Billy Higgins (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7331a3eca750d8b632bb8c6fdc2694f2427759ea","amp;dn":"Donald+Byrd+Royal+Flush%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7331a3eca750d8b632bb8c6fdc2694f2427759ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,49,163,236,167,80,216,182,50,187,140,111,220,38,148,242,66,119,89,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
