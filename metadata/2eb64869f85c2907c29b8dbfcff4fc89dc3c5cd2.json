The cold rationality of electronics joins harmony and the desire of experimentation, edifying a sophisticated and original musicality destined to affirm the Public Domain Resource as new sonic explorers of the Italian avantgarde.\n This album is marked by brilliant intuitions and technological tactics designed to take a further step towards the highest approval ratings from an huge number of electro-connoisseurs: the target is now fully achieved","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eb64869f85c2907c29b8dbfcff4fc89dc3c5cd2","amp;dn":"Public+Domain+Resource+-+Six+Years+%282015%29+Album+%40+MP3+%2F+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eb64869f85c2907c29b8dbfcff4fc89dc3c5cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,182,72,105,248,92,41,7,194,155,141,191,207,244,252,137,220,60,92,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
