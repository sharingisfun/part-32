Just ask Robert Nay, a 14 year old who created Bubble Ball Ã¢â‚¬â€œ downloaded three million times, famously knocking Angry Birds off the top spot. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be a programming veteran to create games using Corona. Corona SDK is the number one tool for creating fun, simple blockbuster games.\n\nAssuming no experience at all with programming or game development you will learn the basic foundations of Lua and Corona right through to creating several monetized games deployable to Android and Apple stores.\n\nYou will begin with a crash course in Lua, the programming language underpinning the Corona SDK tool. After downloading and installing Corona and writing some simple code you will dive straight into game development. You will start by creating a simple breakout game with controls optimized for mobile. You will build on this by creating two more games incorporating different features such as falling physics. The book ends with a tutorial on social network integration, implementing in app purchase and most important of all monetizing and shipping your game to the Android and App stores.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:967c6a644846703cc685b450ad51a69bf0e8da50","amp;dn":"Corona+SDK+Mobile+Game+Development%3A+Beginner%27s+Guide+By+Michelle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"967c6a644846703cc685b450ad51a69bf0e8da50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,124,106,100,72,70,112,60,198,133,180,80,173,81,166,155,240,232,218,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
