Between July 2010 and September 2011 Meat has toured through Canada, The United States, The United Kingdom and Ireland. Many fans have made video recordings of the shows and this DVD contains the best footage combined in one huge show. With funny anecdotes, great hits and 5 of the new songs (well 6 if you count the end credits) this is really the most complete Hang Cool Concert available. Video quality is great for over 98% and the audio is equally great on this DVD. 21 tracks with a running time of 126 minutes. ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c8dd786cf028008c467673deb9d989b1c5cd74a","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+-+The+Hang+Cool+Concert+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c8dd786cf028008c467673deb9d989b1c5cd74a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,141,215,134,207,2,128,8,196,103,103,61,235,157,152,155,28,92,215,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
