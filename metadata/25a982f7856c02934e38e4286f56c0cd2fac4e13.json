This is my own version, not a converted version of the x264 scene release. \n\nThis episode aired on NBC on Jan 31, 2010. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a982f7856c02934e38e4286f56c0cd2fac4e13","amp;dn":"Saturday.Night.Live.S35.Special.Sports.All-Stars.WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a982f7856c02934e38e4286f56c0cd2fac4e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,169,130,247,133,108,2,147,78,56,228,40,111,86,192,205,47,172,78,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
