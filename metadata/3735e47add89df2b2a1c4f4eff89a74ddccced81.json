After a &quot;special&quot; call from Bobo, Ant brings up the chaos in Ferguson, we watch a video of the overnight mayhem as well as one of Michael Brown before the shooting, he goes into Dr. Michael Baden's autopsy report, and then discusses how news reporters are handling this story in general. Lady Di gets through the phone lines for another &quot;special&quot; call to talk about her roommate Bill?s death, Ant examines the ?the fire challenge? and the &quot;ice bucket challenge&quot;, and he ends the show with a few more calls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3735e47add89df2b2a1c4f4eff89a74ddccced81","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3735e47add89df2b2a1c4f4eff89a74ddccced81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,53,228,122,221,137,223,43,42,28,79,78,255,137,167,77,220,204,237,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
