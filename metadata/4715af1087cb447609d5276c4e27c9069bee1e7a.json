Her new brain is not without side-effects, however. Between consciousness and a semi-lucid state called 'drift-diving,' reality splinters. Amnesia and dÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  vu become one, hours and days deleted. But ZaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memories are classified, and she is told she no longer has a 'need to know.' \n\nAfter a mysterious agent propositions her for secrets in exchange for information about her missing father, a tempted Zara dismisses the notion. However when her flight status is unexpectedly revoked, dismay and resentment quickly changes her attitude... because this was not supposed to be the end. \n\nProphetic visions of floating jungles and sentient insects haunt her. An alien terminus? So real, it must be fate. Zara soon sets out into the byzantine world of Lacus Somniorum, the Moon's clandestine Lake of Dreams in search of answers, not only about her past, but also her improbable future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4715af1087cb447609d5276c4e27c9069bee1e7a","amp;dn":"Chronophage_Torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4715af1087cb447609d5276c4e27c9069bee1e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,21,175,16,135,203,68,118,9,213,39,108,78,39,201,6,155,238,30,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
