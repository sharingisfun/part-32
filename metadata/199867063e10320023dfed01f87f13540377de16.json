There are several working modes with\ndifferent modulation waveforms which allow to retain more original\nlow frequencies in the mix. It is optimized for heavy limiting of hard\nmusic (up to -8/-7db total RMS). Can be used for mastering and for\nmixing.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Brickwall lookahead loudness maximizer.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Velocity can be varied from 40mks to 40ms.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Has three limiter modes.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Has built-in algorithm of dithering with noise-shaping.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Supports sampling rates up to 192kHz.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n   PC: Windows XP/Vista/7\n\nFormats Supported\n\n   PC VST 32/64-bit\n\n\n\n\n\nDMAX Audio DSE v1.0\nR2R | Dec 18 2012 | 5 MB\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a stereo enhancer based on the S-channel equalization.\nIt is intended for changing of the stereo imaging of the\nmix.

It is based on the unique proprietary algorithm\nand can be used as a loudness maximizer of a complex signal with drums or\npercussions. For processing the signal DMAX does not use gain reduction\ntherefore it fully retains stereo imaging and original drum transients. Its\nyields completely different sound, unlike usual maximizers. You can\nuse it for limiting of drums/percussions tracks.\n\nFeatures\n\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Brickwall lookahead peak limiter.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Possibility to choose threshold frequency above which the limiter\n   does not process the signal.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Built-in dithering algorithm with noiseshaping.\n   Ã¢Å“Â¶Supports sampling rates up to 96kHz.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n   PC: Windows XP/Vista/7\n\nFormats Supported\n\n   PC VST 32/64-bit\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install\n\n\n         Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
