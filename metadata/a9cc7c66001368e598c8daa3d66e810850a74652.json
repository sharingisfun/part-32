The music was quite uncommercial, complex, and advanced with the emphasis on the arrangements rather than the soloists.\n\nCity Of Glass 1951, This Modern World 51-53 - Bob Graettinger\nBob Graettinger was one of the most radical arrangers around in the 1950s and it is doubtful whether any other jazz big-band leader other than Stan Kenton would have ever employed him. These performances are intense, very dense and quite scary.
