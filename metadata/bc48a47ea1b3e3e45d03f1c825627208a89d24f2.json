Survivors of the feral flesh-eating clan, who were all but destroyed at the end of the first novel, are back and chowing their way through the locals again. Amy Halbard and Claire Carey strive to survive their abduction by the cannibals and save their children. A subplot involving Claire's despicable husband, Steven, gives Ketchum another opportunity to cleverly compare predatory civilized folk to the appetite-driven primitives. The story is suspenseful, fast-paced and intelligently written.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc48a47ea1b3e3e45d03f1c825627208a89d24f2","amp;dn":"Offspring+-+Jack+Ketchum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc48a47ea1b3e3e45d03f1c825627208a89d24f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,72,164,126,161,179,227,228,93,3,241,200,37,98,114,8,168,157,36,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
