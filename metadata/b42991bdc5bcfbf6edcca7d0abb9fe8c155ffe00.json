Ã¢â‚¬â€James Baldwin\n\nThe straight glass pipe filled with ethereal white smoke. It was thick enough to see that it could be a good hit, but it still had the wispy quality that distinguishes crack cocaine smoke from cigarette or marijuana smoke. The smoker was thirty-nine, a black man, who worked as a street bookseller. He closed his eyes and lay back in the battered leather office chair, holding his breath to keep the drug in his lungs as long as possible. Eventually, he exhaled, a serene smile on his face, his eyes closed to savor the bliss.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the computer signaled that another hit was available.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No, thanks, doc,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said, raising his left hand slightly. He hit the space bar on the Mac in the way that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been trained to press to signal his choice.\n\nAlthough I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know for sure whether he was getting cocaine or placebo, I knew the experiment was going well. Here was a middle-aged brother, someone most people would label a Ã¢â‚¬Å“crackhead,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a guy who smoked rock at least four to five times a week, just saying no to a legal hit of what had a good chance of being 100 percent pure pharmaceutical-grade cocaine. In the movie version, he would have been demanding more within seconds of his first hit, bug-eyed and threateningÃ¢â‚¬â€or pleading and desperate.\n\nNonetheless, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just calmly turned it down because he preferred to receive five dollars in cash instead. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sampled the dose of cocaine earlier in the session: he knew what he would get for his money. At five dollars for what I later learned was a low dose of real crack cocaine, he preferred the cash.\n\nMeanwhile, there I was, another black man, raised in one of the roughest neighborhoods of Miami, who might just as easily have wound up selling cocaine on the street. Instead, I was wearing a white lab coat and being funded by grants from the federal government to provide cocaine as part of my research into understanding the real effects of drugs on behavior and physiology. The year was 1999.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b42991bdc5bcfbf6edcca7d0abb9fe8c155ffe00","amp;dn":"HighPrice.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b42991bdc5bcfbf6edcca7d0abb9fe8c155ffe00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,41,145,189,197,188,251,246,237,204,167,208,171,185,254,140,21,95,254,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
