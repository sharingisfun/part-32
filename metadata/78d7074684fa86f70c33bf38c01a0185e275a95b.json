He plays your average nice guy who turns out to have something special up his sleeve when confronted by a gang of bad guys. He tames the banditos and wins dance-hall girl Dietrich's heart with his nonviolent ways. You may think you have seen this before, and most likely you have. Based on the 1930 novel by Max Brand, the plot has been copied repeatedly. However, this atmospheric 1939 delight stands far above its imitators. This is the movie in which Dietrich, wearing full saloon-gal regalia, sings, &quot;See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have.&quot; It was remade with Audie Murphy in 1954 as Destry, but that version lacks the charisma provided by Stewart and Dietrich","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78d7074684fa86f70c33bf38c01a0185e275a95b","amp;dn":"Destry+Rides+Again_S%C3%83%E2%80%9C_FILMA%C3%83%E2%80%A1OS_%281939%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78d7074684fa86f70c33bf38c01a0185e275a95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,215,7,70,132,250,134,247,12,51,191,56,192,26,1,133,226,117,169,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
