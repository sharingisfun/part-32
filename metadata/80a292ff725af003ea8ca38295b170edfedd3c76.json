Singer-guitarist Jacco de Greeuw sings the instantly catchy tunes in flawless unaccented English, in accordance with the grand Europop tradition, and lead guitarist Remco Krull fills the songs with just-so one-note solos and Wedding Present-style strummy riffs. The songs, all originals with the odd and unexpectedly perfect exception of a suitably psychedelic cover of Aphrodite's Child's &quot;It's Five O'Clock,&quot; are uniformly solid, and the simple, straightforward production keeps things relatively unadorned, with the exception of a moody cello on &quot;Swing&quot; and layered, breathy overdubbed harmonies on the trippy &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (not the Bowie song). An unpretentious debut with few weaknesses.
