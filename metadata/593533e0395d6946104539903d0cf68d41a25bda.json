This single CD has at least one selection from each of the records (11 in all) that, when taken as a whole, gives one a good idea as to how strong Quebec was still sounding. Although his fans will want to get the individual records (four of the six are currently available on CD's), this is an excellent sampler. Among the other players are organist Freddie Roach, guitarists Grant Green and Kenny Burrell, pianist Sonny Clark, drummer Art Blakey and Billy Higgins, trombonist Bennie Green and tenor great Stanley Turrentine.
