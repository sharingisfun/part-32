This is the band&amp;#039;s first full-length studio release in four and a half years, the longest gap between The Offspring&amp;#039;s studio albums to date. Its release had been delayed several times since frontman Dexter Holland first announced the album in 2004.\n\nWriting and recording sessions for this album lasted for almost two years, making it the longest time The Offspring have ever spent working on an album. Although drummer Atom Willard (who left in July 2007) was still a member of the band during the recording, session musician Josh Freese actually handled the drum tracks, like he did on the previous album Splinter. Due to contract issues with Geffen Records, Willard was not supposed to do recording on the album and later decided to leave the band and continue his duties in Angels &amp; Airwaves full time whilst Face to Face drummer Pete Parada joined the band just in time for the tour.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by The Offspring, except for &quot;O.C.
