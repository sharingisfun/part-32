It was released in 1990 on Geffen Records and backed with &quot;Will You Love Me&quot;. The song was based on a crush on Cindy Crawford.\n\nThe production on the single and its B-side, &quot;Will You Love Me&quot;, was done by David Thoener and Marc Tanner. It also appears as the first track on Nelson&amp;#039;s album, After the Rain.\n\nIt became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990, the duo&amp;#039;s only chart-topper.\n\nIt was also critiqued on Season 2 of Beavis and Butthead where the boys thought they were &quot;chicks who look like guys&quot; and thought they were Ozzy Osbourne&amp;#039;s granddaughters or Elvis&amp;#039;s children.\n\nThe Nelson brothers spent two years learning how to write songs and in the process, met LA artist/producer Marc Tanner who became their mentor. Together, Marc, Gunnar, and Matthew brainstormed and wrote what would become the triple-platinum After The Rain album in 1990 after being signed to [Geffen Records] in 1989. \n\nTheir singles, &quot;(I Can&amp;#039;t Live Without Your) Love and Affection&quot;, &quot;After the Rain&quot;, &quot;More Than Ever&quot;, &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; and &quot;(You Got Me) All Shook Up,&quot; all held positions on Billboard&amp;#039;s top 40 with &quot;Love and Affection&quot; reaching #1 in September of 1990 after receiving airplay on [MTV] where they also had #1 videos. \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:430cb250de67ccdb3b07431ccee84c8206c10cc9","amp;dn":"Nelson+-+Love+And+Affection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"430cb250de67ccdb3b07431ccee84c8206c10cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,12,178,80,222,103,204,219,59,7,67,28,206,232,76,130,6,193,12,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
