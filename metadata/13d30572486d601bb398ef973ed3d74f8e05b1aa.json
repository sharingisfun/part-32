Multi-award-winning writer Robert Macfarlane sets out on a journey to explore the unexpected landscapes and natural history of Essex, revealing that there is far more to the county than the stereotypes of white stilettos and boy racers. Macfarlane spends a year travelling the county's strange and elemental landscapes of heavy industry, desolate beaches and wild woods. He encounters massive knot flocks over the Thames and peregrine falcons at Tilbury Power Station.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.80GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:CPJQK4SINVQBXM4Y56LT5U6XJ6HALMNK\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13d30572486d601bb398ef973ed3d74f8e05b1aa","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+The+Wild+Places+of+Essex+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13d30572486d601bb398ef973ed3d74f8e05b1aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,211,5,114,72,109,96,27,179,152,239,151,62,211,215,79,142,5,177,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
