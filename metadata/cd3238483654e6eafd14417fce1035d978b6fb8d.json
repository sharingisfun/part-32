This time we present you a full featured\nUMD emulator, reboot &amp; exitgame tight - you have to turn off your PSP completely \n(or crash it :p ) to get it back to original state. This is a semi-final version,\nsome things are known not to work properly for now (see below).\n\n- play your favourite LEGIT backuped ISOs from the main menu of your PSP !\n- full UMD emulation via selected ISO, either for game, video and audio !\n- possibility to bypass updater check within the menu\n- possibility to remove/redirect updater icon\n- possibility to set any regioncode, even for games ...\n- CPU speed setup (currently for ISOs only)\n- sleepmode works within games now ! See &quot;ToDo&quot; for more\n- possibility to redirect flash0: (user config) and flash1: (kernel data)\n  to memorystick (and no, this is NOT a rip of the lately released MPH application)\n- USB is automatically activated within the emulator config\n- configuration will be automatically saved and reloaded on app restart\n- reload the ISO list by pressing SELECT button\n- restart emulator config by pressing START button\n- maybe some more which i just forgot to mention :) ...\n\n\n***** This application DOES NOT write to the flash, everything is done in RAM only ! *****\n\n\nNow you can use all the nifty functions like versionchanger, pmf replacer or button changer\nbut you dont need to write to the flash anymore ! Just replace the necessary files on your\nmemstick while using flash emulation. Hope some ppl will find this useful :D ...\n\n\nCopy all the files from this drawer onto your memstick to use this app, should look like\nthis after :\n\nPSP/\n|\n+--- GAME/\n|\t|\n|\t+--- UMDEMULATOR/\n|\t|\t\t|\n|\t|\t\t+--- EBOOT.PBP\n|\t|\n|\t+--- UMDEMULATOR%/\n|\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t+--- EBOOT.PBP\nUMDEMULATOR/\n|\t|\n|\t+--- ISO/\n|\t|\t|\n|\t|\t+--- &lt; place your ISOs here &gt;\n|\t|\n|\t+--- core.bin\n|\t+--- menu.bmp\n|\t+--- config.dat\n|\t|\n|\t/\n|\t/\n|\t|\n|\t+--- UPDATEICON\t\t&lt;-- optional, create for updater icon replacement\n|\t\t|\n|\t\t+--- EBOOT.BIN\t&lt;-- started when updater icon selected (0146 error currently)\n|\t\t+--- PARAM.SFO\t&lt;-- updater param.sfo\n|\nF0/\t\t\t\t&lt;- optional, flash0: replacement drawer\n|\nF1/\t\t\t\t&lt;- optional, flash1: replacement drawer\n\n\n\n\nConfig information\n------------------\n\nCPU/Bus speed\t\t- 222/111 , 266/133 , 333/166 MHz speed setup\nISO mode\t\t- turn the iso emulation on or off (off : original inserted UMD is used)\nDisctype ISO\t\t- the type of the UMD your selected ISO represents (game, video or audio)\nDisctype UMD\t\t- the type of the really inserted UMD in the drive (game, video or audio)\nUpdater icon\t\t- original : Update icon will be displayed if ISO/UMD contains UPDATE/ drawer\n\t\t\t- memstick : PARAM.SFO and EBOOT.BIN are taken from memstick path\n\t\t\t  UMDEMULATOR/UPDATEICON/ (app wont start properly currently)\n\t\t\t- remove   : remove the updater icon completely\nRegioncode game\t\t- region code jap/us/eur/regionfree for games\nRegioncode video\t- region code jap/us/eur/regionfree for video\nRegioncode audio\t- region code jap/us/eur/regionfree for audio\nFlash0 emulation\t- on: redirect all flash0: accesses to memstick path F0/\nFlash1 emulation\t- on: redirect all flash1: accesses to memstick path F1/\n\nFlash redirection function\n--------------------------\n- if the file is present on memstick it gets loaded from there\n- if the file is not present, original flash file gets loaded\n- if the file IS present on memstick, and just contains the word &quot;NOLOAD&quot; (uppercase !)\n  the file isnt loaded at all !\n\nToDo\n----\n- CPU speed for original UMD does not work for now\n- Main menu crashes when put into sleepmode ! Dunno why, for now go into a game for sleepmode ...\n- Regioncode setup is somewhat strange, works fine for ISOs, but not on original audio/video UMDs\n- For the techies : flash0:/vsh/module redirection doesnt work for now, all the rest is redirected\n- Updater icon replacement to memstick doesnt start the app currently (0146 - prohibited load)\n- Autodetect disctype for inserted UMD and ISO\n- Much nicer GUI :D\n\nHope you will enjoy this latest piece of homebrew ...\n\nHumma Kavula !\n\n\nP.S.: Dunno if the newest games will work, dont have access to them i'll keep watching the\nforum ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd3238483654e6eafd14417fce1035d978b6fb8d","amp;dn":"PSP+Fast+Loader+v+0.8+AKA+UMD+Emulator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd3238483654e6eafd14417fce1035d978b6fb8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,50,56,72,54,84,230,234,253,20,65,127,206,16,53,217,120,182,251,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
