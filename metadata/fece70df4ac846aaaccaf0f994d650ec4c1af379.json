In fact, optimism may be crucial to our existence. Tali SharotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiments, research, and findings in cognitive science have contributed to an increased understanding of the biological basis of optimism. In this fascinating exploration, she takes an in-depth, clarifying look at how the brain generates hope and what happens when it fails; how the brains of optimists and pessimists differ; why we are terrible at predicting what will make us happy; how emotions strengthen our ability to recollect; how anticipation and dread affect us; and how our optimistic illusions affect our financial, professional, and emotional decisions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fece70df4ac846aaaccaf0f994d650ec4c1af379","amp;dn":"The+Optimism+Bias%3A+A+Tour+of+the+Irrationally+Positive+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fece70df4ac846aaaccaf0f994d650ec4c1af379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,206,112,223,74,200,70,170,172,202,240,249,148,214,80,236,76,26,243,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
