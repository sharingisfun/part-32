Whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re moving cross-country, settling a family feud, dealing with heartbreak, or just having fun with one another, their lives are utterly relatable. No wonder America canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough. But what have Kourtney, Kim, KhloÃƒÂ©, and the rest of the Kardashian clan got that we havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got? Off-the-charts beauty, millions of dollars, and Kris JennerÃ¢â‚¬â€the superstar mom and manager who made them into the family we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist.\n\nOn Keeping Up with the Kardashians, we watch Kris do it all. She runs a household, manages her childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successful careers, produces four television shows featuring her larger-than-life family, and still finds time to tweet to her fans. How does she manage to maintain her composure, enviable elegance, and unflappable sense of humor? After raising six children of her own, in addition to being a stepmother to four and a grandmother, multitasking is KrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way of life. But she would have never made it without her unwavering belief in God.\n\nIn this thoughtful, candid, and no-nonsense memoir, Kris Jenner is an open book about the good times and the rough patches. She shares the reality of living her hectic life in the celebrity spotlight, touching on topics that will resonate with women everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â€love, loss, marriage, divorce, motherhood, and faith. Kris talks about her marriages to Olympic champion Bruce Jenner and Robert Kardashian, the late father of her four oldest childrenÃ¢â‚¬â€and how it was Bruce who finally helped end the KardashiansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ messy divorce so they could all move forward as a family. She writes with candor and vivid insider detail about her close friendships with Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. Simpson, as well as NicoleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder, its aftermath, and the infamous trial. She also puts her oftencontroversial parenting style under the microscope as she relates the details of her decision to make her charming family into an international brand with a blockbuster reality television franchise.\n\nIf you think your life is chaotic, try keeping up with Kris Jenner.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c20ba92da6bd59d34c93e1f50a966b2815c2b4","amp;dn":"Kris+Jenner+.+.+.+And+All+Things+Kardashian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c20ba92da6bd59d34c93e1f50a966b2815c2b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,194,11,169,45,166,189,89,211,76,147,225,245,10,150,107,40,21,194,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
