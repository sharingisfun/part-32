With the ability to create and share online your own levels, you are up for an infinite replay value! The game is visualized as a classic tabletop board-game with dice and tokens. You can destroy walls and auto-heal as you uncover new dungeon tiles, which widens your choice of moves.&quot;\n\nGame modes:\nAdventure Mode:\n- Begin every dungeon as a new map from a long campaign: each time, your character resets to level 1. Unexplored parts of the dungeons are hidden by a fog of war. Monsters and items are placed at random, combats based on your statistics and dice rolls. Mitigate the combatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s result with a 2d6 (one for damages and the other for effects). Favor one attribute when you level up. Unlock and collect sets of dice (common/uncommon/rare/epic), but Beware! Monsters use their own too. An awareness system makes the monsters move towards you if you are in their line of sight. Dig up the walls to flee, at the cost of some precious health...\nRogue Mode:\n- Your character doesn't reset at each new dungeon and keeps leveling up until you meet your demise. What will remain is your name in the Hall of Fame and more powerful sets of dice that you can use in your next Rogue run.\nPuzzle Mode:\n- Hardcore campaign levels with no place for luck. No fog of war: the dungeon's layout (mobs and items) is shown. Monsters are static and won't move towards you. Strategize all your moves to ensure victory.\n\nv1.17 changelog:\nGame balance:\n- Defense for both Classes and Monsters has been significantly raised up.\n- Each class has its own leveling system, plus distinct bonuses when leveling on Adventure and Rogue modes.\n- Warrior: High defense | Medium damages | Medium life | Low mana\n- Archer: High defense | Low damages | Medium life | Medium mana\n- Priest: Medium defense | Medium damages | Very high life | High mana\n- Mage: Medium defense | Medium damages | Low life | Very high mana\n- Thief: Medium defense | High damages | Medium life | Medium mana\n- The increase of spell casting costs between each zone has been greatly reduced. For example, upon entering Zone IV, a Warrior can now cast 2 Ice Blasts and a Mage up to 5.\n- Ice Blast damages have been slightly reduced.\n- Magical monsters have now 50% damage resistance against Ice Blast and Fire Blast spells, so they are more distinct from other monsters (and give a wider array of tactic choices depending on monster types).\n- Vampiric monstersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Drain damages have been reduced by 20%.\n- Void difficult mode: monstersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rank bonuses on statistics have been reduced to match the Classic difficulty mode.\nNew Rogue mode:\n- Rogue mode is now subdivided into 5 difficulty zones: 4 classic zones (Temperate, Jungle, Desert and Volcanic) plus a special Demonic zone with its own tile set.\n- Once your character is level 20, the next dungeon will be a Dragon Nest. Defeating the Elder dragon will lead you to a higher difficulty zone. Your goal is to reach level 100 and vanquish the Demon Lord to complete the Rogue mode.\n- Zone 4 (Volcanic) includes Dragons as normal monsters.\n- Zone 5 (Demonic) includes Dragons and Demons as normal monsters. Each monster is equipped with epic dice sets.\n- The Hall of Fame and rewards now reflect this new Rogue mode progression.\nNew features:\n- You can now click on your character to pass a turn, which is useful to let monsters go back to sleep state or to let an activated monster move towards you (ex. Mage class can now wait on the same tile until the mob enters blasting range).\n- Adventure &amp; Rogue modes: while playing in a dungeon, it is now possible to open the dice selection page, choose 2 new dice sets and resume your game.\n- Added tool tips (details of your future statistics) on the Level up bonus selection.\n- Added a button to reset scores in the Hall of Fame.\nUI improvements:\n- Added Fly over buttons with tool tips on the Level up bonus selection.\n- Added an animated button with fireworks on &quot;Game Completed&quot; message.\n- Added an erase score button into the Hall of fame.\nFixed bugs:\n- Fixed player game icon not moving properly when receiving damages.\n- Fixed player game icon of the wrong gender that showed when reloading a level.\n- Can no more select an item in inventory when another one is currently in use.\n- Fixed loot erased when the player was moving past this loot.\n- Fixed gold amount not refreshed when grabbing multiple chests.\n- Fixed class change on next Rogue level.\n- Fixed damages details not updating when attacking a monster at distance.\n- Fixed damage details still showing when [No fight details] option was activated in the option menu.\n- Fixed damage modifications miscalculations after a dice roll.\n- Fixed some menus (Shop, Temple...) that wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t close in Rogue mode after the latest patch (1.16).\n- Fixed Wizard eyes uncovered zones that still showed when going in the next Rogue dungeon.\n- Fixed Crude staff equipment not working properly.\n- Fixed some Rare dice sets (16, 31, 40, 49, 58 and 67) where the Damage die would display inverted sides.\n- Fixed Mana and Life bonuses miscalculations on some equipment.\n- Fixed game crash when testing an editor level that was created without any monsters inside.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/283040/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/283040/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f90438c423f639b0e8869423d464b511a681be3","amp;dn":"Paper+Dungeons+v1.17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f90438c423f639b0e8869423d464b511a681be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,144,67,140,66,63,99,155,14,136,105,66,61,70,75,81,26,104,27,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
