The 5 friends book their own tours, do their own artwork, record and mix their own albums and have set up their overly efficient business model all by themselves.\nAll this in order to do what they do best and love the most Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to travel the world and play music. Since their incarnation dating no further back than the year 2006 the band has achieved impressive results in terms of touring and has a steady growing fan base around the world. Scarred by beautyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relentless appetite for touring has enabled them to tour Europe and the UK several times and seen the band as support for internationally acclaimed artists such as The Black Dahlia Murder, I Killed the Prom Queen, The Ghost Inside, Terror, Everytime I die, For the Fallen Dreams, Asking Alexandria, Unearth, Gojira and Meshuggah. In 2011 alone the band completed three European tours, one Danish tour, and in 2012 they, besides touring Europe and UK for two months, made it all the way to China playing a highly successful spot at the Shanghai MIDI Festival. The band also appeared as headlining act on the annual MTV Headbangers Ball Tour across Denmark in 2012.\n\nNow theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re launching their sophomore monster of an album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cape ZeroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, upon the world and set out to tour as heavy as they have ever done before.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Cape ZeroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a testament of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capabilities and a clear definition of their relentless and ruthless work ethics. The music reveals a matured band now fully aware of their sound and hardcore roots, making the album stand out to the predecessors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Ã¢â‚¬Å“We SwimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ EP from 2009 (which awarded them Ã¢â‚¬ËœTalent of the Year at the Danish Metal Awards) and their debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“SutraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 2011. The style is full frontal hardcore but with undeniable technical skills and a superb flair for melodic hooks, riffing and dynamics. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re claiming genre independency simply due to the fact that the 5 piece are all contributing equally and individually - and it shows perfectly in each and every of the 11 songs. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkably varied and diverse but nicely coherent and whole while the lyrical subjects and cover artwork tie the frustration, fears and desolation together.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Cape ZeroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be put out worldwide in September through German based Redfield Records handling all digital platforms and Danish vinyl connoisseurs Screaming Records issuing the heavy weight deluxe vinyl edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f4aaa91e8ce470ad4070cdaee0f40bc31d1df66","amp;dn":"SCARRED+BY+BEAUTY+-+CAPE+ZERO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f4aaa91e8ce470ad4070cdaee0f40bc31d1df66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,74,170,145,232,206,71,10,212,7,12,218,238,15,64,188,49,209,223,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
