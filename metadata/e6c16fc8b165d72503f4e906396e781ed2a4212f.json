LandisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lifelong personal study of the fascinating subject of the intelligence of early man is readily apparent.\n\nThe IQ level required to visualize, engineer and build the many Ã¢â‚¬Å“out of place artifactsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ discussed and pictured in this large format book baffles those who are steeped in DarwinianÃ¢â‚¬â€œstyle explanations of the origin of man, as taught in public schools and the secular media.\n\nPrepare to be exposed to information and photographs you have probably never read or seen before! Thousands of hours of research, trips to numerous sites throughout North and Central America, visits to museums, and meetings with myriad experts in various nations have provided LandisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ team with an overwhelming amount of evidence for the unquestionably high level of intelligence of these early innovators. A jumble of anomalies and magnificent structures continue to confound archaeology and anthropology today, yet as the dots are connected, one finds history as described in the biblical record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c16fc8b165d72503f4e906396e781ed2a4212f","amp;dn":"The+Genius+Of+Ancient+Man+-+Don+Landi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6c16fc8b165d72503f4e906396e781ed2a4212f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,193,111,200,177,101,215,37,3,244,233,6,57,110,120,30,210,164,33,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
