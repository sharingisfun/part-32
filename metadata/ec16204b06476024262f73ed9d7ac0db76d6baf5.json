Its exponents combine religion, philosophy, psychology, and physical culture into one composite science and art. The word yoga has been applied not only to the central aim of attaining heightened consciousness, but also to the development of every human faculty - physical, emotional, and ethical - which may conduce to that end. This volume, based largely upon the leading classical books on the subject, is supplemented in many cases by the author's own experience\r\nwith advanced exponents and practitioners of the art. It shows that the judicious introduction of selected yoga methods and practices can be of great benefit in the stormy and nerve-racking conditions of modern life in the West as well as in the East.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPRONUNCIATION OF SANSKRIT WORDS 7\r\nINTRODUCTION 9\r\n1 The Why and the How ofYoga n\r\n2 The Goal ofYoga 21\r\n3 The Ethics and Morality ofYoga 37\r\n4 Yoga and the Intellect 58\r\n5 The Breathing Practices ofYoga 80\r\n6 The Postures ofYoga 106\r\n7 Sense-control, Purifications, and other Practices 122\r\n8 The Latent Body-Power ofYoga 140\r\n9 TheJourney and Goal of the Latent Power 159\r\n10 Yoga and Vitality 174\r\n11 The Use of Sounds in Yoga Practice 186\r\n12 The Yoga of the BhagavadGitd 216\r\n13 The Basic Philosophy of Yoga 235\r\nGlossary of Sanskrit Words 249\r\nOriginal Sanskrit Books and Treatises quoted 259\r\nBooks on Yoga in English 259\r\nIndex 263\r\n \nhttp://s29.postimg.org/5lrx8zv1j/Yoga_Pelican.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec16204b06476024262f73ed9d7ac0db76d6baf5","amp;dn":"Yoga+%28Pelican%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec16204b06476024262f73ed9d7ac0db76d6baf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,22,32,75,6,71,96,36,38,47,115,237,157,122,192,219,118,214,186,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
