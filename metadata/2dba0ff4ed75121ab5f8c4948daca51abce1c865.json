The reason the file is so large (for a single track), is because it is high quality and also - such a long track. I have not loaded this up with a bunch of bollocks that you don&amp;#039;t need - in the .RAR file, there is simply the track, the artwork, and a small readme file that asks you nicley to support the band. Please buy their material if you like it.\n\nThanks,\n\nNickWhite xx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dba0ff4ed75121ab5f8c4948daca51abce1c865","amp;dn":"Meshuggah+-+I+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dba0ff4ed75121ab5f8c4948daca51abce1c865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,186,15,244,237,117,18,26,181,248,196,148,141,172,165,26,188,225,200,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
