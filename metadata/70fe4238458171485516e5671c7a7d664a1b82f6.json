Some great classic rock (sure it's mostly pop favorites, but nonetheless a nice, tight little collection). As some reviewers have pointed out, the music is what really kept this movie afloat by adding energy to the action sequences and distracting the viewer from the cheesy, sub-par plot. The added material here isn't that great, and I always thought it sort of silly when they add music not from the movie to the soundtrack with the &quot;inspired by&quot; heading. Even so, it's a good soundtrack if you like classic rock... great car music that I'm sure will make it into my rotation during commutes to work.\n\nOne thing that needs clarification, apparently, is that this is a soundtrack NOT a score. There is a difference. Soundtracks consist of pop-music-type songs that appear in movies but were not written expressly for the movie (for the most part), whereas the score is the music composed FOR the movie. I have not heard the score for this movie (though it is available, and Clint Mansell is an excellent composer, so I'm sure it rocks), but I tend to think much of the African music was part of Mansell's score. So if you're looking for that, check out the score CD, rather than the soundtrack.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70fe4238458171485516e5671c7a7d664a1b82f6","amp;dn":"Sahara+-+Soundtrack+2005+Southern+Rock+320cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70fe4238458171485516e5671c7a7d664a1b82f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,254,66,56,69,129,113,72,85,22,229,103,28,122,125,102,74,27,130,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
