On the run from an old romantic interest who won't take no for an answer, Rhapsody literally bumps into a couple of shady characters: half breeds who come to her rescue in the nick of time. Only the rescue turns into an abduction, and Rhapsody soon finds herself dragged along on an epic voyage--one that spans centuries and ranges across a wonder-filled fantasy world.\n\nThis is my first ever torrent, and represents a small piece of the work I'm doing personally on my own library. This is the original recording of this book, not the newer one with Kevin T. Collins narrating. I've cleaned up the hiss from the tapes this came from, and broken it out into chapters to make it easier to find favorite passages. If this seems like something the community likes, I've got dozens and dozens more books I've performed similar work on that I can upload. I hope you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f908726555bb9b3d1fdd6c28a3970df400b52e19","amp;dn":"Rhapsody%3A+Child+of+Blood+-+Elizabeth+Haydon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f908726555bb9b3d1fdd6c28a3970df400b52e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,8,114,101,85,187,155,61,31,221,108,40,163,151,13,244,0,181,46,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
