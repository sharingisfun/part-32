Even if you have never been a farmer or a gardener, this book covers everything you need to know to get started: buying and saving seeds, starting seedlings, establishing raised beds, soil fertility practices, composting, dealing with pest and disease problems, crop rotation, farm planning, and much more. Because self-sufÃ¯Â¬ï¿½ciency is the objective, subjects such as raising backyard chickens and home canning are also covered along with numerous methods for keeping costs down and production high. Materials, tools, and techniques are detailed with photographs, tables, diagrams, and illustrations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec4ddad3e5b757d5f5a48933dc030cd64624d8fc","amp;dn":"Mini+Farming+-+Brett+L+Markham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec4ddad3e5b757d5f5a48933dc030cd64624d8fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,77,218,211,229,183,87,213,245,164,137,51,220,3,12,214,70,36,216,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
