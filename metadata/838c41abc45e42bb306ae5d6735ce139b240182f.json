Picture yourself walking for days in the driving snow; you don&amp;#039;t even know you&amp;#039;re walking in circles. The heaviness of your legs in the drifts, your shouts disappearing into the wind. How small you can feel, and how far away home can be. \nHunter Patch Adams: Home. The dictionary defines it as both a place of origin and a goal or destination. And the storm? The storm was all in my mind. Or as the poet Dante put it: In the middle of the journey of my life, I found myself in a dark wood, for I had lost the right path. Eventually I would find the right path, but in the most unlikely place.\nmore \nMovie Connections:Spoofed in &quot;Futurama: Bendin&amp;#039; in the Wind (#3.13)&quot; (2001) more \nSoundtrack:Stand more \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ\nThis FAQ is empty.

Just a hair off center, but still well in the bullseye., 28 December 1998\n\n\nAuthor: StephenC from Kansas City, MO, USA \n\nDuring a family day at the movies over Christmas weekend, most of my family picked &quot;You&amp;#039;ve Got Mail&quot;. But I pretty much detest romantic comedies, so I picked &quot;Patch Adams&quot; instead. How much did I like it? I went and saw it again the next day, dragging the whole family with me this time.\n\nDon&amp;#039;t let the previews fool you: this is not a comedy. This is a very moving drama based on the real life of Hunter &quot;Patch&quot; Adams and his trials on the road to becoming a doctor and attempting to revolutionize the health care industry by creating a free hospital in West Virginia (which has come to pass and is presently being constructed, or so the overlayed tagline at the end of the movie claims).\n\nWilliams delivers a stellar performance as Patch, who practices &quot;Laughter Is The Best Medicine&quot; and entertains and amuses hospital patients in an effort to befriend them and ease their pain. So as you can imagine, Williams&amp;#039; clownish personality and humor seep in and bring an incredible vibrance to the character. His performance alone is worth your ticket, but the supporting actors (Philip Hoffman and newcomers Daniel London and Monica Potter) also deliver great performances and add a lot to the story. The plot is well done (being partially written by Adams) and the story may inspire you.\n\nMy only major complaint about the movie (and why I say it&amp;#039;s a hair off center) is the very stereotypical and uber-evil portrayal of the dean of the medical school, who has a vendetta against Adams but for which a real reason is never given. (This could be attributed to Adams&amp;#039; hand in the scripting, but I doubt it.)\n\nBeyond that, this movie is very enjoyable, very touching, and very award-worthy. If it doesn&amp;#039;t show up at least a couple times at the Oscars I&amp;#039;ll be very disappointed. But just go see it for yourself. And if you don&amp;#039;t cry at least once before the end, be worried; there is probably something wrong with you.\n\nIf you enjoy the movie, you may also want to check out the book by the real Patch Adams, entitled &quot;Gesundheit!: Bringing Good Health to You, the Medical System, and Society Through Physician Service, Complementary Therapies, Humor, and Joy&quot;. Amazon.com carries it (as should any other reputable bookseller). \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:838c41abc45e42bb306ae5d6735ce139b240182f","amp;dn":"Patch+Adams%2C+Robin+Williams%2C++1998+xvid+please+seed+2%2B+copies%2C+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"838c41abc45e42bb306ae5d6735ce139b240182f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,140,65,171,196,94,66,187,48,106,229,214,115,92,225,57,178,64,24,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
