His entire life has been orientated by football and he possesses the potential, but has never had the courage or discipline to make anything of it. Jimmy is spotted by Ken Jackson, whilst playing for his pub team. Ken is the manager of Hallam football club, a local non-league team. After continually playing brilliantly for Hallam, Jimmy gets offered a trial at Sheffield United. The evening before the trial he gets drunk, and wakes up feeling very rough. Consequently he fails to impress the Sheffield United manager. Jimmy then has to consider his future and his choices and if he has the self discipline to succeed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e35390f0e081e08ff9f2e5dcc3cbb1fe8133065b","amp;dn":"When+Saturday+Comes+%281996%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e35390f0e081e08ff9f2e5dcc3cbb1fe8133065b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,83,144,240,224,129,224,143,249,242,229,220,195,203,177,254,129,51,6,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
