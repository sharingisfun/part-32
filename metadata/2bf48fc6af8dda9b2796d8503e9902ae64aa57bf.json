He has become obsessed with books of chivalry, and believes their every word to be true, despite the fact that many of the events in them are (clearly) impossible. Quixano eventually loses his mind from little sleep and food and because of so much reading. He decides to go out as a knight-errant in search of adventure.\n\nPlease seed 1:1\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf48fc6af8dda9b2796d8503e9902ae64aa57bf","amp;dn":"Miguel+de+Cervantes+-+Don+Quixote","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bf48fc6af8dda9b2796d8503e9902ae64aa57bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,244,143,198,175,141,218,155,39,150,216,80,62,153,2,174,100,170,87,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
