I'm saddened to learn, just now, of his passing on June 19th. As co-publisher, along with Gary Groth, of Fantagraphics Books and everything that falls underneath their banner, his contribution to the world of alternative comics is beyond measure. No doubt, he will be missed. Peace and solace to his family and friends.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'At Home with Rick Geary - Collected Stories 1977-85'\n\nFantagraphics Books, \n\nWritten and Illustrated by Rick Geary\n\nA collection of Rick's very short stories. Nearly everything in this book is just one or two pages. But man, the line work is just outstanding. Beautiful looking book, to my eyes, anyway.
