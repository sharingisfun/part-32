Brown\n\n2012 | 272 Pages | ISBN: 0307888347 | EPUB | 5 MB\n\n\nImagine if you could identify your businessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most profitable customers, craft a better marketing strategy to communicate with them, and inspire them to buy more?\n\nWell now you can. And the best part is that you can do it using the data you already have.\n\nToday, everything we do creates data, and the volumes are enormous. Virtually every time someone views something online, enters search on Google, or even surfs the web on a smart phone, another chunk gets added Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in real time - to the multibillion gigabyte (and growing) trove of data that can help us better understand and predict consumer behavior. We no longer need expertise in math or statistics or even expensive modeling software to get the most out of all these revealing consumer insights. A revolution in data analysis is underway, and the methods and tools for aggregating and analyzing this Ã¢â‚¬Å“data delugeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are suddenly far simpler, less expensive, and more precise than they were.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:636dbfc3067199df7b5afcd57068d3b4372dc808","amp;dn":"Sexy+Little+Numbers%3A+How+to+Grow+Your+Business","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"636dbfc3067199df7b5afcd57068d3b4372dc808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,109,191,195,6,113,153,223,123,90,252,213,112,104,211,180,55,45,200,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
