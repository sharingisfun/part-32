One aim of the series is to dispel the intimidation such readers often feel when faced with the work of a difficult and challenging thinker. John Duns Scotus (1265/6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1308) was (along with Aquinas and Ockham) one of the three principal figures in medieval philosophy and theology, with an influence on modern thought arguably even greater than that of Aquinas. The essays in this volume systematically survey the full range of Scotus' thought. They take care to explain the technical details of his writing in lucid terms and demonstrate the relevance of his work to contemporary philosophical debate. New readers will find this the most convenient and accessible guide to Scotus currently available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b796811ab5d3c48bf9df1108c8486d87c9c4e9b","amp;dn":"Cambridge+Companion+to+Duns+Scotus+%5BENG%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b796811ab5d3c48bf9df1108c8486d87c9c4e9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,121,104,17,171,93,60,72,191,157,241,16,140,132,134,216,124,156,78,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
