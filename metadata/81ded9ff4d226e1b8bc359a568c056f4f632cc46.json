Whether youâ€™re a professional DJ creating a new sound, or a hobbyist who wants to rock out on virtual drums, SoundStage gives you a diverse toolset to express yourself.\r\nIf you look at old rock concerts, youâ€™ll see these HUGE synthesizers that the musicians connect together to make electronic sounds. These instruments are literally enveloping the player. SoundStage attempts to capture the feel of those epic music machines then take it to the next level with tools only possible in a virtual environment. All in a world inspired by the airbrush paintings and computer graphics of the 80s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ded9ff4d226e1b8bc359a568c056f4f632cc46","amp;dn":"SoundStage+v8.26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ded9ff4d226e1b8bc359a568c056f4f632cc46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,222,217,255,77,34,110,27,139,195,89,165,104,192,86,244,246,50,204,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
