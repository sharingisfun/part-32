It clocks in at a little over 15 minutes.\n\nMP3 (320 kbps)\n\nTracks include:\n\n&quot;Intro - (Evil Aeternum)&quot;\n\n&quot;Born Demonic&quot;\n\n&quot;Hyper-Kill Transformation&quot;\n\n&quot;Subterranean Nightmare&quot;\n\n&quot;The Devious Grotesque&quot;\n\n&quot;Outro - (Purified in Filth)&quot;\n\nAlso, there's an MP3 of &quot;Subterranean Nightmare (Full Demo)&quot; (purportedly for the &quot;nostalgia&quot; of &quot;tape trading&quot; back in the day. Plus each song flows into the next without the annoying MP3 &quot;pause&quot; between tracks - a constant headbanging tour de force, instead!).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc30ae7a2e2d33cf2dda7bca5e436f92a4c8908","amp;dn":"Declared+Dead+-+Subterranean+Nightmare+%28Demo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc30ae7a2e2d33cf2dda7bca5e436f92a4c8908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,195,10,231,162,226,211,60,242,221,167,188,165,228,54,249,42,76,137,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
