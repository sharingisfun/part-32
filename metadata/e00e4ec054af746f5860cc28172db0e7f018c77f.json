But despite lively interest in renewables generally, there is an information vacuum about the smallest version of the technology dubbed &quot;the simplest, most reliable and least expensive way to generate power off grid.&quot;\r\n\r\nHighly illustrated and practical, Microhydro is the first complete book on the topic in a decade. Covering both AC and DC systems, it covers principles, design and site considerations, equipment options, and legal, environmental, and economic factors.\r\n\r\nScott Davis has decades of experience operating, installing, designing, selling, and teaching about microhydro technology. An award-winner in the field, he currently works as a system designer and retailer with an alternative energy company for whom he has authored an on-line microhydro course","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e00e4ec054af746f5860cc28172db0e7f018c77f","amp;dn":"Microhydro+-+Clean+Power+from+Water","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e00e4ec054af746f5860cc28172db0e7f018c77f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,14,78,192,84,175,116,111,88,96,204,40,23,45,176,231,240,24,199,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
