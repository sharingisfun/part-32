The first British Rail locomotives to be fitted with a modern electric train heating system, the 33 quickly spread across the whole Southern Region and could occasionally be seen much further afield, mostly running passenger services but also turning its hand to freight operations. A total of 98 examples were built, fitted with 1,550-horsepower Sulzer engines, and they proved popular with crews. The Crompton worked throughout the BR Blue and Network Southeast eras, and 40 survived in service up to the privatisation of the network and continued working for their new owners, EWS. These have now been retired from service, though a number survive in preservation today. With 7 authentic liveries and Sea Lion ballast hoppers, the Class 33 Add-On for Train Simulator is a classic for British Rail diesel fans.\n\nIncludes:\nClass 33 diesel locomotive in 7 liveries: BR Green, BR Blue, BR Dutch Grey, EWS Maroon, BR General Grey, Network Southeast, BR Sector Grey\n\nSea Lion ballast hopper wagons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da67ac859943a73a8679ed26a4984c473d91b217","amp;dn":"Train+Simulator+2013+-+Class+33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da67ac859943a73a8679ed26a4984c473d91b217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,103,172,133,153,67,167,58,134,121,237,38,164,152,76,71,61,145,178,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
