The word 'Agni is one of the most important of the Vedic gods, the god of fire and the acceptor of sacrifices, a messenger from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day, and also immortal and 'Rudra' means wild, of rudra nature, and translates the name Rudra as &quot;the Wild One&quot; or &quot;the Fierce God&quot;. The band has stood the test of time to become one of the most loved rock bands in the country. It grew up struggling with sub-standard instruments and disinterested recording labels, but always with the goal of carving an identity of their own. A record company &quot;Virgo&quot; took notice and their first album 'Wind Dance With Fire' was released in 1993. All this was enough impetus for the band and they came up with the concept for their second album 'Mrityunjaya' - Victor Over Death. Agni returned in pristine white, pure in sound, Indian to the very core and burning brighter than ever before.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc385dc2f2303cdf7e314c19b84da339b6305c8d","amp;dn":"RudrAgni+%5B%5Bdiscography%5D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc385dc2f2303cdf7e314c19b84da339b6305c8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,56,93,194,242,48,60,223,126,49,76,25,184,77,163,57,182,48,92,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
