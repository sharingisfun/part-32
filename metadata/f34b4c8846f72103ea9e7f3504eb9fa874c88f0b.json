Plans have been brewing for months, and now two Colorado-born craftsmen are tuned up and ready for a unique silver anniversary celebration. Rock/bluegrass band Leftover Salmon and Breckenridge Brewery have each enjoyed twenty-five years of success. To commemorate this milestone they have joined forces to release a collaborative beer, packaged with twenty-five live tunes from Leftover Salmon. The pair also came together for the Hootenanny on July 18th, a day long concert celebration at the brand new Breckenridge Brewery in Littleton, CO, which featured multiple musical acts and a headlining performance by Leftover Salmon.\r\n\r\nBack in March, the two groups got together over a few pints to share ideas on just the right beer recipe for the momentous occasion. They embraced an India Pale Lager style and aptly named it Silver Salmon. â€œA hoppy lager is a lighter, thirst-quenching style that we thought would be perfect for an outdoor music scene,â€ explains Brian Reinecke, the brewer for Breckenridge Brewery who formulated the recipe. â€œWe used American hops that give the beer flavor and aroma, but not too much bitterness. To give Silver Salmon some depth, we used Vienna malt and added in some flaked oats. The oats increase the body and give the beer a visual dimension, an opalescence.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f34b4c8846f72103ea9e7f3504eb9fa874c88f0b","amp;dn":"Leftover+Salmon+-+25+%282015%29+%5B320kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f34b4c8846f72103ea9e7f3504eb9fa874c88f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,75,76,136,70,247,33,3,234,158,127,53,4,235,159,168,116,200,143,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
