However, this is one of those rare cases in  *\n* which the traditional scan is actually crisper at a similar resolution, which is  *\n* partly a testimonial to DTs' craftsmanship and partly due to the artwork's style  *\n* and bright/light palette. Thus, I ended up using traditional versions throughout. *\n*************************************************************************************\n\nContains:\n\nBEASTS OF BURDEN - The four-issue miniseries from 2009. Minutemen-DTs releases.\n\nHELLBOY/BEASTS OF BURDEN: SACRIFICE - 2010 cross-over issue, also Minutemen-DTs.\n\nSHORTS - Seven stories of less than issue-length, published in various Dark Horse anthologies from 2003 to 2012. Independent Scanners and more Minutemen-DTs releases.\n\nMisses: Nothing, I believe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0ad806444ccf9c29c2c52da872b834e7e64c81","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Beasts+of+Burden+%28DH%7C2003-2012%7CMinutemen%29+%26reg%3B1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0ad806444ccf9c29c2c52da872b834e7e64c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,10,216,6,68,76,207,156,41,194,197,45,168,114,184,52,231,230,76,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
