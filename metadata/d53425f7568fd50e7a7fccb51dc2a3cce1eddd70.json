In this latest collection of stories culled from the hit Shadowline Web comic series, learn how the previous Nightmare World tales of Irish fairy-folk, vengeful zombie killers, alien ultra-heroes, Cthulhu, and more combine with these 13 new tales of terror of Lucifer''s sinister plan to control Creation, revealing the haunted underbelly of a monstrous world all too similar to our own in the chilling tradition of Tales from the Crypt and The Twilight Zone. Includes an introduction by Gary (Deadworld) Reed, re-mastered art, a bonus prose story, and more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53425f7568fd50e7a7fccb51dc2a3cce1eddd70","amp;dn":"Nightmare+World+Volume+3+%28PDF%29+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53425f7568fd50e7a7fccb51dc2a3cce1eddd70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,52,37,247,86,143,213,14,122,127,204,181,29,194,163,204,225,237,221,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
