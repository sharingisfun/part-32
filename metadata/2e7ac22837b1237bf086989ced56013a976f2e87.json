But that's one of their few clunkers.  In case you were not aware, there are also a few demos you can listen to on their MySpace page.\n\nFormat is .wma at a variable bit rate.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e7ac22837b1237bf086989ced56013a976f2e87","amp;dn":"Manufacture+-+Terrorvision%2C+Voice+of+World+Control%2C+and+an+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e7ac22837b1237bf086989ced56013a976f2e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,122,194,40,55,177,35,123,240,134,152,156,237,86,1,58,151,111,46,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
