The result is a combination of modern R&amp;B sounds and classical samples from Beethoven, among others. \nThe album's best tracks are simply the ones that incorporate these classical sounds, and En Vogue takes us to their suite with &quot;Love U Crazay,&quot; the difficult classical harmonies of &quot;Sad But True,&quot; and &quot;Love Won't Take Me Out,&quot; and &quot;Whatever Will Be Will Be,&quot; all emphasize the beauty of the classical piano and luscious harmonies. \nThe group eventually turns it up with the funky &quot;Latin Soul,&quot; and their first single off the album, &quot;Riddle.&quot; Other notable tracks include a neo-soul-like &quot;No No No (Can't Come Back),&quot; and &quot;Those Dogs,&quot; the latter which takes a few listens to get used to. \nEn Vogue steers away from the sounds of modern, male/female-battle-oriented R&amp;B, and give us their Masterpiece Theater...
