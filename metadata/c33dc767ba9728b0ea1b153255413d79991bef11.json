On this 1998 CD reissue, Heath sticks to tenor, performing &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot; and &quot;The More I See You' while joined by pianist Cedar Walton and his two brothers, bassist Percy Heath and drummer Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath. The other five numbers consist of four of his originals (best-known is &quot;Gemini&quot;) plus a reworking of the ballad &quot;Goodbye.&quot; For these selections, the quartet is augmented by young trumpeter Freddie Hubbard (who takes a few fiery solos) and Julius Watkins on French horn. The arrangements of Heath uplift the straightahead music and make each selection seem a bit special. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Gemini\n02 - Bruh' Slim\n03 - Goodbye\n04 - Dew and Mud\n05 - Make Someone Happy\n06 - The More I See You\n07 - Prospecting\n\nEnjoy and share!
