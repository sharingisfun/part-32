Its name comes from the second line of the album&amp;#039;s first track, &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot;, an English folk song from the 1500s. It peaked on the U.S. charts at #4. Produced by Bob Johnston. Columbia Records LP CL 2563 (mono); CS 9363 (stereo); CD CK 9363; Remastered CD CK 66001.\n\nThe album can be seen as having a protest element in it: the closing song, &quot;7 O&amp;#039;Clock News/Silent Night&quot;, contained clips of a news broadcast about the Vietnam War. Based on the fact that the broadcast carries the news of the death of comedian Lenny Bruce that day, it can be dated from 3 August 1966.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 201 on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
