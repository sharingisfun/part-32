Although the album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as previous albums, having also peaked at #25 on the UK Album Chart (where all her previous studio albums had been Top 10 successes). In December 2005, however, the album was nominated for a Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award, while Sheryl Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy Award for the song &quot;Good Is Good&quot;. The album was certified platinum in the U.S. in December 2005, and as of January 2008, it had sold 949,000 units (over the counter) there. A deluxe edition of the CD was also released, which contains an additional DVD featuring acoustic versions of many of the album's tracks, as well as the promotional video for the lead single &quot;Good Is Good&quot;.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Tammy La Gorce - Since her 1993 debut, Tuesday Night Music Club, Sheryl Crow has been churning out unassailably appealing CDs in an unassailably appealing voice. Which means, according to the rules of the pop music cosmos, by album six it's about time for a misstep. Natural law, fortunately, will have to keep checking its watch. Wildflower moves Sheryl Crow one step closer to Hall of Fame status as she shunts the established rock star's impulse to get all experimental, but instead sprawls, rambling rose-like, across the substance-spiked pop landscape she helped pioneer. Three ingredients, glistening vocals, flawless production, and catchy songs rub up against one another in all the right places. These ingredients will cause you to hold your breath on the beautiful piano ballad &quot;Always on Your Side.&quot; They pop up again on the George Harrison-esque &quot;Where Has All the Love Gone&quot; reminding you that Crow can reflect and reveal as convincingly as she can rock. If there is a ripple that runs through Wildflower, it's a pensive one. On the spacy &quot;Chances Are,&quot; she sings of being &quot;...lost inside a daydream.&quot; The measure of her talent, ripe and reappraisal-resistant, is her ability to consistently bring us inside the bubble with her.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I Know Why\n[02] Perfect Lie\n[03] Good Is Good\n[04] Chances Are\n[05] Wildflower\n[06] Lifetimes\n[07] Letter To God\n[08] Live It Up\n[09] I Don't Wanna Know\n[10] Always On Your Side\n[11] Where Has All The Love Gone\n[12] Always On Your Side\t&gt; Featuring Sting\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 00h:50m:54s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 359mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 27 September 2006\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.sherylcrow.com \n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/crow.html \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/sherylcrow \n&gt;\n&gt;[Wildflower]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8badaa57c3b24a64be14a22bff2b3314e4308d19","amp;dn":"%5B2006%5D+Wildflower+-+Sheryl+Crow+359mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8badaa57c3b24a64be14a22bff2b3314e4308d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,173,170,87,195,178,74,100,190,20,162,43,255,43,51,20,228,48,141,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
