Real-life experiences are presented in their wider historical context: What were a couple's alternatives to staying together? What were the longevity rates and how long was the average marriage until death ended it? What were the differences between the experiences of wealthier and poorer spouses? In a provocative and lively style, Elizabeth Abbott puts a human face on marriage as she explores its nature in the context of love, sex, loyalty, childrearing, shared finances, and social recognition.\nGenre: Non-fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c078891bb507fe8f536629a3f8990c84c36a84a2","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Marriage+-+Elizabeth+Abbott.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c078891bb507fe8f536629a3f8990c84c36a84a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,120,137,27,181,7,254,143,83,102,41,163,248,153,12,132,195,106,132,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
