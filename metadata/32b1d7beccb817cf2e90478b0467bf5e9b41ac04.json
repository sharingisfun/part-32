Additional personnel: Cris Kirkwood       \n          (acoustic guitar, bass); Pat Smear, Curt Kirkwood (acoustic guitar); Lori Goldston   \n          (cello). Recorded live at Sony Music Studios, New York, New York on November 18,     \n          1993. UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK is part of MTV's &quot;Unplugged&quot; series. UNPLUGGED IN NEW    \n          YORK won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance. What is         \n          ultimately so sad about Kurt Cobain taking his own life is that he was so giving to  \n          others, constantly campaigning for the artists who influenced him. Cobain breathed   \n          new life into the Raincoats' career (who thanked him on their latest EP), brought a  \n          wider audience to Eugenius' pop genius, and proved there was grunge in Seattle before\n          the '90s by covering a Wipers song on INCESTICIDE. The same reverential awe seeps    \n          through every minute of the UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK performance, released nearly a year\n          after its recording in November 1993. Cobain's originals, from the wrenching &quot;All    \n          Apologies&quot; to the numbing &quot;Dumb,&quot; exempify his rare gift of saying so much with      \n          deceptively simple chords and melodies. His choice of covers displays influences as  \n          diverse as David Bowie and the Meat Puppets, and possibly most surprising,           \n          Leadbelly--included is a ferocious version of &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night?       \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and albuminfo,           \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.About A girl                [03:37]                                        \n                 02.Come as you are             [04:14]                                        \n                 03.Jesus doesn't want me for   [04:37]                                        \n                    A sunbeam                                                                  \n                 04.The man who sold the world  [04:21]                                        \n                 05.Pennyroyal tea              [03:41]                                        \n                 06.Dumb                        [02:53]                                        \n                 07.Polly                       [03:16]                                        \n                 08.On A plain                  [03:45]                                        \n                 09.Something in the way        [04:02]                                        \n                 10.Plateau                     [03:38]                                        \n                 11.Oh me                       [03:26]                                        \n                 12.Lake of fire                [02:56]                                        \n                 13.All apologies               [04:23]                                        \n                 14.Where did you sleep last    [05:08]                                        \n                    night                                                                      \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               53:57 min                                       \n                                                76,4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b1d7beccb817cf2e90478b0467bf5e9b41ac04","amp;dn":"Nirvana-Unplugged_In_New_York-%28Retail%29-1994-HHI.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b1d7beccb817cf2e90478b0467bf5e9b41ac04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,177,215,190,204,184,23,207,46,144,71,139,4,103,191,94,155,65,172,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
