It starts off with an hour-long intermixed EDM set, portions of which will be the basis for a pre-dawn EDM set during Tootie's DJ stint at the Dragon Boat Festival, and some tracks of the set have been utilized in one of Cribstopper's Review mixes, who is the host of OMGDDRBBQ. Next is a selection of music in Dance Dance Revolution, the classic rhythm game which is the headline attraction of OMGDDRBBQ. It's also a sneak eavesdrop of content that will be included with the forthcoming major update to DDresampled - The Full Versions, which is creeping ever so closer to release. The mix ends with an EDM pairing, the latter of which is a track used in a Cribstopper Review mix.\n\n   deadmau5 - Right This Second\n   Yenn - Forward\n   Spam Junkies - Wake Up\n   Sandro Silva, Arston - Symphony\n   Rudy Rox - Dragon\n   Mekki Martin - When the Sun Comes Out (Stefano Pain &amp; Marcel Remix)\n   deadmau5, Wolfgang Gartner - Channel 42\n   Wolfgang Gartner - Push &amp; Rise\n   Bass Kleph feat.
