Notable is the fact that &quot;Johanna&quot; and &quot;I Got Nothin&amp;#039;&quot; were both recorded previously by the James Williamson-era Stooges. Kill City was originally recorded in 1975 after the disintegration of the group. It was to be used as a demo to give to labels in hopes of getting Pop a new contract. His vocals were recorded on weekends when he received permission to leave a mental hospital he was staying in at the time for treatment of his long-standing heroin addiction. There would be no takes until James Williamson got an advance for Bomp to release the album; some of which was used to remix the original recordings.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c83ee6e0e3beda30706f8dea1323d6179cddc0e","amp;dn":"Iggy+Pop+and+James+Williamson-Kill+City-Vinylrip-Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c83ee6e0e3beda30706f8dea1323d6179cddc0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,131,238,110,14,59,237,163,7,6,248,222,161,50,61,97,121,205,220,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
