After his brother abdicates, George ('Bertie') reluctantly assumes the throne. Plagued by a dreaded stammer and considered unfit to be king, Bertie engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Through a set of unexpected techniques, and as a result of an unlikely friendship, Bertie is able to find his voice and boldly lead the country through war.\n\nRuntime.......:1h 54mn\nLanguage..........:ENGLISH\n\nIMAGiNE NOTES\nVIDEO:The Kings Speech scr - Demedic  .....
