There is a new vernacular emerging in the realms of data representations, but that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean we can ignore the much simpler origins and best practices of charts and graphs.\n\nBrian Suda takes you on a journey through the basics and makes it easy to produce beautiful looking, accurate representations of data. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll walk you through how to visualize and design data in such a way that it engages the reader and tells a story rather than just being flashy, cluttered and confusing.\n\n\n# Paperback: 225 pages\n# Publisher: Mark Boulton Design Ltd; 1 edition (August 9, 2010)\n# ISBN-10: 0956174086\n# ISBN-13: 978-0956174086","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:489765174a42997c858e9235f359a5e1acbfa6bf","amp;dn":"A+Practical+Guide+to+Designing+with+Data+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"489765174a42997c858e9235f359a5e1acbfa6bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,151,101,23,74,66,153,124,133,142,146,53,243,89,165,225,172,191,166,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
