The Doctor starts to recover, and tells Tegan how to escape. When the TARDIS lands on Castrovalva, the local inhabitants are all too happy to help with the Doctor's recovery but he realises something is wrong. The whole city is another one of Adric's projections.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c919fe9d7cbb63de7c4684bba62b874e61de2c26","amp;dn":"Dr+Who+-+S19E01+-+P4+-+Castrovalva","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c919fe9d7cbb63de7c4684bba62b874e61de2c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,25,254,157,124,187,99,222,124,70,132,187,166,43,135,78,97,222,44,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
