It received new attention in 1992 when Quentin Tarantino used it in the opening of his movie &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. The album has a very Euro-pop feel, some of it sounding a little Beatles-esque. Hard to find record, and nice sonics too.\n\ntracks:\n\nA1 Little Green Bag 4:20 \nA2 Winter Time 2:07 \nA3 Funny Girl 3:00 \nA4 The Prisoner 4:48 \nA5 Road Of Peace 2:56 \nA6 Fly 2:50 \nB1 Dear Ann 3:04 \nB2 Impressions 3:30 \nB3 I Wanna Love You 2:50 \nB4 Have Another Drink 3:22 \nB5 I'll Be Your Baby Tonight 4:09 \nB6 Goodbye 4:00\n\nmusicians:\nJohannes Bouwens (George Baker), Jan Hop, Jacobus Anthonius Greuter, Jan Gerbrand Visser, George The \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6c67784faf2ccd1af9422cd97b4909335548e9","amp;dn":"George+Baker+Selection+-+Little+Green+Bag+%281970%29+%5BVinylRip+24-96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6c67784faf2ccd1af9422cd97b4909335548e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,108,103,120,79,175,44,205,26,249,66,44,217,123,73,9,51,85,72,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
