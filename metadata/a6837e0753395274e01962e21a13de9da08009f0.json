The young Noor falls in love with Firdaus, the Begum's daughter (Tunisha Sharma). To break-up the unwanted relationship, Hazrat Begum sends off Firdaus to London and tells Noor to make something out of his life and career before raising his eyes towards Firdaus.\r\n\r\nNoor finds a benefactor and with his help goes to Delhi to study. In time he grows up to be one of the more successful young artists of India (Aditya Roy Kapoor). Firdaus too grows up to become a beautiful woman (Katrina) and is engaged to be married to a Pakistani diplomat Bilal (Rahul Bhatt).\r\n\r\nWork takes Noor to London, where he meets Firdaus and the old passions are ignited. But Hazrat Begum, despite Noor's success, adamantly wishes to marry off Firdaus to Bilal. At this time, Noor finds out that his secret benefactor is not Hazrat Begum as he had thought but Moazzam - an escaped terrorist whom he had once befriended.\r\n\r\nAt this devastating turn in his life, Noor and Firdaus learn that the latter is not the daughter of Hazrat begum but a girl she had adopted. Hazrat Begum too is at the end of her life, and the two lovers are untited at last..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nBased on the novel Great Expectations by Charles Dicken's Fitoor uses the backdrop of gorgeously portrayed and photographed Kashmir to tell the tale of two lovers faced with an insurmountable social divide. If Aditya Roy Kapoor looks properly bemused and besotted, Katrina manages to look pretty but does nothing much else. It is Tabu who steals the show and her not so believale character of Hazrat begum comes alive. She is at once imperious and coquettish, a tragic lover and an obstacle to love. If the film holds your attention, it is because of Tabu.\r\n\r\nTechnically this is a film to watch for its cinematography. Kasmir is out there in all its glory for you to see. The beautiful chinar leaves and the snow crystals make it look magical. But it also becomes unreal, for you start wondering if there is nothing else to Kasmir. Where is the strife and the disaffection? What happened to the anger that is usually manifest? It is a snitised Kashmir and somehow less believable.\r\n\r\nMusic adds to the film with some songs standing out. Editing is good as a full Charles Dickens novel is condensed into just over two hours. But in conclusion, had it not been for Tabu, it would have been hard to sit through the film!\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nA good DVD which required very little work. We have enhanced details a bit, done some shadow gaining to improve upon the scenes and carried out some minot corrections of color. The images of Kashmir have come out far better and you would enjoy those..\r\n\r\nOn top of it this rip has the 10-bit compressibility. The magic of x265, allowed us to compress the video to just 2GB despite using the original AC3 5.1 Channel audio.\r\n\r\nDo take a look at the sample provided :)\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on most stand-alone devices.
