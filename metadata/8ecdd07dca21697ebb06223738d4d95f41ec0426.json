Building your word power will help you write more effectively, communicate clearly, score higher on standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, or GRE, and be more confident and persuasive in everything you do.\n\nBut in order to truly increase your vocabulary, you need a system that works. With most guides, you end up only memorizing the new words for a short time, often not even long enough to use them in tests. Fiske WordPower is different.\n\nUsing the exclusive Fiske system, you will not just memorize words, but truly learn their meanings and how to use them correctly. This knowledge will stay with you longer and be easier to recall-and it doesn't take any longer than less-effective memorization.\n\nHow does it work? This book uses a simple three-part system:\n1. Patterns: Words aren't arranged randomly or alphabetically, but in similar groups that make words easier to remember over time.\n2. Deeper Meanings, More Examples: Full explanations-not just brief definitions-of what the words mean, plus multiple examples of the words in sentences.\n3. Quick Quizzes: Frequent short quizzes help you test how much you've learned, while helping your brain internalize their meanings.\n\nFiske WordPower is the most effective system for building a vocabulary that gets you clear and successful results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ecdd07dca21697ebb06223738d4d95f41ec0426","amp;dn":"Fiske+Word+Power%3A+The+Exclusive+System+to+Learn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ecdd07dca21697ebb06223738d4d95f41ec0426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,205,208,125,202,33,105,126,187,6,34,55,56,212,217,95,65,236,4,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
