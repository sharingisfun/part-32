The primary members were Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork, who were the public face of a music production system under the supervision of Don Kirshner. At the start, the band members provided vocals, and were given some performing and production opportunities, but they eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band&amp;#039;s name. The group undertook several concert tours, allowing an opportunity to perform as a live band as well as on the TV series. When the show was cancelled in 1968, the band continued releasing records until 1971. In the 1980s, the television show and music experienced a revival, which led to a series of reunion tours, and new records featuring various incarnations of the band&amp;#039;s lineup.\nInfo taken from &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is from the &amp;#039;Far East&amp;#039; tour, and captures a band that at least live, probably still had something to prove.\nYou can also enjoy a couple of &amp;#039;hot rocking&amp;#039; Japanese DJ&amp;#039;s whose voice overs, bring a huge smile to my face, somehow I think this was pretty serious stuff for them.\nClearly from a radio broadcast of the show - FM thankfully - but remember this was 1968, so don&amp;#039;t expect audio heaven, that said it is highly listenable, after the initial intros.\n\nTracklist\n01_The Monkees - Last Train To Clarksville   03:15\n02_The Monkees - I Wanna Be Free   02:40\n03_The Monkees - Dw Washburn   02:46\n04_The Monkees - Daydream Believer   02:17\n05_The Monkees - Cuddly Toy   02:34\n06-The Monkees - Salesman   03:30\n07_The Monkees - It&amp;#039;s Nice To Be With You   02:51\n08_The Monkees - Mary, Mary   02:24\n09_The Monkees - Cindy, Cindy   01:54\n10_The Monkees - Peter Percival Patterson&amp;#039;s Pet Pig Porky   00:45\n11_The Monkees - Johnny B Goode   02:13\n12_The Monkees - Gonna Build A Mountain   03:41\n13_The Monkees - I Got A Woman   06:25\n14_The Monkees - I&amp;#039;m A Believer   02:09\n15_The Monkees - (I&amp;#039;m Not Your) Steppin&amp;#039; Stone   04:57\nRunningtime  44:13 min\n\nLineup\nMicky Dolenz - Drums/Vocals\nDavy Jones - Percussion/Bass/Vocals\nMichael Nesmith - Guitar/Vocals\nPeter Tork - Bass/Organ/Banjo/Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d9a705ebb765ce8275164242e355cbc041b8ca","amp;dn":"The+Monkees+-+Made+in+Japan+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d9a705ebb765ce8275164242e355cbc041b8ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,217,167,5,235,183,101,206,130,117,22,66,66,227,85,203,192,65,184,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
