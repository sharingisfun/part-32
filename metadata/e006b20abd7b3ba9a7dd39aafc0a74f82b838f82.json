Anderson received degrees in engineering, physics and philosophy as a student graduating with honors from West Virginia University, California State University, the Joint-Services Military College and the University of Minnesota. \n\nHe was employed at a young age by the United States Air Force conducting advanced research and development at the prestigious Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert. He later founded an organization call the TTRC, an advanced time-technology research laboratory located on Long Island, New York in the United States of America.\n\nDuring that time he proposed several new detail on theories for reversing time at sub-light speeds and laid the foundations for what would later become known as time-warped field theory, an approach that modeled and described how to use the natural forces of inertial frame dragging for power generation and to create contained and controllable fields of closed time-like curves. \n\nAnderson provided one of the first comprehensive overviews of the historical views of time, time control and time travel in the documentary &quot;Time Travel - Journeys into Time.&quot; His ideas were later applied for the development of high performance time reactor systems for energy production and time technology research at what is known today as the Anderson Institute.\n\nAnderson is the President and CEO of Anderson Multinational LLC, the parent corporation of the Anderson Institute and several other companies, headquartered in Rochester, New York. He holds multiple patents relating to time technology and also for time reactor designs. His published works include more than thirty articles and video lectures on spacetime physics, time control technologies and methods and the philosophy of time. He has appeared on numerous radio and television shows worldwide including Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell in the USA. \n\nAnderson is also President and CEO of the World Genesis Foundation whose mission is to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œleave no child without hope for the futureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and is active as a speaker and Ambassador for Youth for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and also for the Romanian government.\n\nLinks\n\nAnderson Institute: http://www.andersoninstitute.com/ - Innovation and Excellence in Time Technology\nAnderson Multinational LLC: http://www.andersonmultinational.com/ - Building a Better Tomorrow\nWorld Genesis Foundation: http://www.worldgenesis.org/ - Leave No Child Without Hope for the Future &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.skybooksusa.com/books/danderson.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.skybooksusa.com/books/danderson.htm&lt;/a&gt; - Peter Moon's (of The Montauk Pulse) website featuring DVDs/CDs of David Anderson, Joseph Farrell and others\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\tDr. David Anderson - Exponential Times.mp4\n\n[img=http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae194/geogaddi00/DrDavidAnderson-ExponentialTimes.png]\n\nThe Next Generation.

He recapped his work from 2002, when he last appeared with Art on the show. At that juncture, his team had created small time warp fields that he said could accelerate time by 300% within the field, as well as reversing time. He described the initiation of a time warp field as quite spectacular to witness, &quot;between the combinations of different chemical reagents and high energy lasers we use to excite or initiate a time warp field...a lot of light, a lot of energy.&quot;\n\nSince 2002, the effects have increased by &quot;two orders of magnitudes,&quot; both in time acceleration and retardation rates, and living organisms have been successfully tested in the warp fields, he detailed. By regenerating &quot;closed timelike curves&quot; (bending spacetime so time loops back on itself) we're finding it &quot;just as easy to move backwards in time as well as forward,&quot; Anderson explained.\n\nCurrently countries such as Japan, China, and especially India have been experimenting with time technologies, Anderson reported. Through a device called the Temporal Tremor Detector (TTD), his team is able to track such experiments by observing disruptions in the spacetime fabric, he said. \n\nAs time technology becomes further developed, moral and ethical issues are arising, he pointed out. Benefits of the technology include accurate historical studies of the past, but on the negative side, we could experience &quot;Time Wars,&quot; with deliberate destruction of parts of the timeline. Anderson advocated for more transparency and disclosure of the technology, so the public can have input on how it's used. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\tThe Montauk Pulse featuring David Anderson\n\n[img=http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae194/geogaddi00/TheMontaukPulse-DavidAndersonDisapp.jpg]\n\nDavid Anderson Reveals Secrets of Time - Page1 of 2009v3n20cvr.pdf\nThe Montauk Pulse - David Anderson Disappears - 2002v2n13.pdf\nDavid Anderson Sightings - 2007v3n9.pdf\n\nAbout the newsletterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThe Montauk Pulse, a newsletter chronicling the events and circumstances concerning The Montauk Project since 1993, is published quarterly and includes at least six pages packed with cutting-edge news on everything from linguistics and ancient history to modern day time travel and interdimensional realities.
