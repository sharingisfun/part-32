Incredible book detailing the more sinister aspects of the abduction phenomenon including military abductions, mind programming, manipulative implants, cloning and reanimation, and psychological/sexual torture by hostile aliens. Karla Turner tragically died of breast cancer in 1996, some suspect this was the deliberate termination of a dynamite researcher. It?s easy to see why when you read this book.\n\nwww.montalk.net/reviews\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:595f48aab803f9aec8a041103ccf5e67a292a64d","amp;dn":"Karla+Turner+-+Taken%3A+Inside+the+Alien-Human+Agenda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"595f48aab803f9aec8a041103ccf5e67a292a64d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,95,72,170,184,3,249,174,200,160,65,16,60,207,94,103,162,146,166,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
