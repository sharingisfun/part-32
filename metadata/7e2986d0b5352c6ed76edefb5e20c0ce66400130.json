Old Gould Kane, long into his retirement as a top cop, looks to be the #1 suspect with a motive so deep and intense even Gould's old partner suspects him. But the truth is Gould's the only cop worth a damn to solve the cryptic case. The clues could lead Gould to a new and perhaps even greater profession in his twilight...as a very bad man. Mr. Murder is Dead is a 'who didn't do it' set in the fading world of Golden Age comic strips. A criminal's lament to all things past, present and meaningless. Published in partnership with Zachary Quinto ('Star Trek,' 'Heroes') and Before the Door.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2986d0b5352c6ed76edefb5e20c0ce66400130","amp;dn":"Mr.+Murder+is+Dead+%282011%29+HC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2986d0b5352c6ed76edefb5e20c0ce66400130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,41,134,208,181,53,44,110,215,110,222,251,94,32,192,206,102,64,1,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
