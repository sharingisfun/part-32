Yet now the consensus is that he made some of the finest pop/rock recordings of his era. Sure, he had more promotional push than any other rock musician of the '50s; no, he wasn't the greatest singer; and yes, Elvis, Gene Vincent, Carl Perkins, and others rocked harder. But Nelson was extraordinarily consistent during the first five years of his recording career, crafting pleasant pop-rockabilly hybrids with ace session players and projecting an archetype of the sensitive, reticent young adult with his accomplished vocals. He also played a somewhat underestimated role in rock &amp; roll's absorption into mainstream America -- how bad could rock be if it was featured on one of America's favorite family situation comedies on a weekly basis?\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nFocusing primarily on Rick's early-'60s material for Imperial, this 27-cut disc is not quite as rocking as Volume One, but still offers plenty of worthy moments. It includes all of his massive, mid-tempo teen idol ballad hits of the era: &quot;Young World,&quot; &quot;A Wonder Like You,&quot; &quot;Teenage Idol,&quot; &quot;It's Up to You,&quot; and the number one hit &quot;Travelin' Man.&quot; Teen ballads they might have been, but James Burton's masterful guitar licks and Nelson's assured, committed delivery placed them leagues above other teen-idol hits of the period. Of more interest to serious fans are the inclusion of several minor hit singles and covers of R&amp;B tunes. And of course, there's the first-class rockabilly hit &quot;Hello Mary Lou&quot; (penned by Gene Pitney), perhaps his best recording of the decade. His surprisingly raucous cover of &quot;Summertime&quot; features, amazingly, the same bassline used as a hook on the Blues Magoos' psych-pop-garage hit &quot;(We Ain't Got) Anything Yet&quot; years later. The pleasures of this CD are modest but consistent.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-rick-nelson-vol-2-r13834&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-rick-nelson-vol-2-r13834&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002UX3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002UX3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
