At the time these tracks were recorded the fledgling band was tentatively named &quot;Civilian;&quot; the band would officially release their music under the name &quot;Audioslave,&quot; and these three tracks were dropped from the self-titled first release in 2002. I have been hording these in my personal archive for 6 years, and now that the band members have gone their separate ways, I&amp;#039;m releasing them for the first time.\n\nTrack 15 &quot;Give&quot; is a bad recording, but a good song, and a must have for any true fand and collector.\n\nTracks 16 and 17 &quot;Golden Visions&quot; and &quot;We Got the Whip&quot; are great recordings of what are probably the best songs to come out of that first recording session from the group.\n\nP.S.\n\nBe on the lookout for Chris Cornell&amp;#039;s upcoming solo album co-written and produced by Timbaland.\nYou can hear just a brief portion of 2 of the new songs in the new VCast commercial from Verizon Wireless.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e579fd1382148c99a7ce120cfdf2e539ca1bf691","amp;dn":"Audioslave+Unreleased+%28Give%2C+Golden+Visions%2C+We+Got+The+Whip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e579fd1382148c99a7ce120cfdf2e539ca1bf691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,121,253,19,130,20,140,153,167,206,18,12,253,242,229,57,202,27,246,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
