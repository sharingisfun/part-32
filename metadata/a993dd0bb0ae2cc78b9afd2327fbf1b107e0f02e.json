After replacing one logic board I needed to add a serial number in order to use certain applications.  It works fine on MacBooks previous to 2009, both Intel and PPC. It doesn't delete or replace previously created serial numbers. \n\nYou'll need to have a blank cd or dvd and boot from it once created the image.\n\nInstructions are inside the file.\n\nI didn't create, nor know who the creator of this torrent is.
