I'd buy them all to get better quality videos.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e9b2fad11101f7ca218b76da2ce2136257db04a","amp;dn":"The+Alarm+-+Nuclear+Valdez+unplugged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e9b2fad11101f7ca218b76da2ce2136257db04a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,155,47,173,17,16,31,124,162,24,183,109,162,206,33,54,37,125,176,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
