We've forgotten our sharing roots with things like this...why share to some and not others? Who gives us the power to say who can and cannot get the same access as another? This is the world we live in but we don't have to always accept it. Do what you can to end their exclusivity; this is just a small part,I urge you to keep it going. Thank you for your time.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid Axelrod ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Earth Rot\n\n==Info==\nArtist: David Axelrod\nAlbum(s): Earth Rot\nGenre: Jazz / Orchestral\nYear: 1999\nSource: Amazon.com MP3\nCodec: mp3\nBitrate: +/-256kbs\nCovers: Front\n\n==Track Listing==\nThe Warnings Part I\n2.
