In 1986, in honor of Marvel Comics' 25th anniversary, Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter launched the New Universe line of comics. This was to be a distinctly separate world, fully divorced from the mainstream continuity of the Marvel Universe, consisting of its own continuing characters and stories in a more realistic setting. Includes all New Universe character appearances up to newuniversal that I could find. Also has all of newuniversal that I could find. If there are any problems with this torrent let me know please. Not sure if I did this right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134f4ea750d56303390e1a1f0c13482a620dbada","amp;dn":"New+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134f4ea750d56303390e1a1f0c13482a620dbada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,79,78,167,80,213,99,3,57,14,26,31,12,19,72,42,98,13,186,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
