At\nthe age of I4, He declared that He would henceforth be known as Sai Baba, \nand that His mission\nwas to bring about the spiritual regeneration of humanity by demonstrating \nand teaching the\nhighest principles of truth, righteous conduct, peace, and divine love. He has \ndedicated His life\nto helping those in need, by setting up numerous educational and medical \ninstitutions _for the\nunderprivileged in the poorest areas, free of charge and still vigorously \ncontinues doing so at the\nage of 73. His ashram, Prasanthi Nilayam (the Abode of Peace), is frequented \nby millions of peo-\nple annually, both devotees and the curious attracted to His miracles but His \nbiggest miracle is\nthe transformation of hearts and lives. He has no distinction between caste \nand creed or race and\nreligion. He teaches and exempli?es e Unity in DiversityÃ‚Â».\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“There is only one religion, the religion of Love,\nThere is only one language, the language of the Heart,\nThere is only one caste, the caste ofHurnanity,\nThere is only one God and He is Omnipresent&quot;\nHis birthplace, once a tiny rural village; is now a beautiful university town with \nschools and col-\nleges lining its main street. In addition, hundreds of villages in surrounding \nareas have been adop-\nted by Baba's voluntary workers who have built roads, bridges, schools and \ndug wells for them.\nRegular medical camps care for the health of thousands of the locals and \nBaba's Education pro-\ngramme has been implemented in schools throughout India and other \ncountries. The inspiration\nof Sathya Sai Baba's example and message of sel?ess love and service has \nresulted in the esta-\nblishment of over 1,200 Sathya Sai Baba Centers in I37 countries worldwide. \nCenter activities\ninclude the studying of the teachings ofSathya Sai Baba as well as the sacred \nliterature of all reli-\ngions, group devotional singing, spiritual meditation, and selfless service to \nthe community,\nsociety, the world, and the environment. People from all walks of life attend \nthe Center programs.\nThere is no fee for membership in a Sathya Sai Baba Center, and members are \nnever required to\npurchase books or materials. Donations are never solicited.\n\n\n\nWhy this CD?\n\nDuring His public discourses, Sai Baba often sings, improvising,\nsmall verses carrying the essence of the teaching\nthat He wishes to convey at that moment.\nHis echoing voice vibrating our hearts, it embraces everyone listening.\nThese chants have been the inspiration_for this CD.\nRich in content, profound in meaning and spiritual in music,\nthe depth of the Raga ( melody), Bhava (sentiment) and Tala (beat/rhythm)\noflndian music prompted us to fuse a western assembly to\nSai Baba's voice and indian Instruments with the aim of sharing\nthis golden voice of peace and love with the whole world.\nThis CD includes also the bhajan Ã¢â‚¬Å“Murali Gana Lola&quot; (devotional popular song)\nand The Gayatri mantra known as the most important prayer of the Hinduist \nreligion\nThis project was possible thanks to the help and cooperation provided by\nthe Sri Sathya Sai Spritual Heritage Museum that gave us, from his archive,\nsome recording of Sai Baba.\nIt is with great joy that we have produced this CD\nand our hope is that everyone will be able\nto rejoice in hearing His extraordinary voice;\nboth as spiritual seekers and as music lovers.\nGIANLUCA &amp; GABRIELE DUCROS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b748a8333636e00b07de2691165cd2a4e6a7804","amp;dn":"Sri+Sathya+Sai+Baba+-+Embodiment+of+Love+%28cd2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b748a8333636e00b07de2691165cd2a4e6a7804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,116,138,131,51,99,110,0,176,125,226,105,17,101,205,42,78,106,120,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
