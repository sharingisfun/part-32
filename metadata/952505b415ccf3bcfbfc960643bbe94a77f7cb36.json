But more interesting than the crime itself is Olsen's portrait of Nelson as a brash, trashy, manipulative sexpot who believed that she was entitled to (and got) everything and everyone she wanted: even her confession, given freely to police in a Pizza Hut restaurant, was anything but contrite. Moreover, Olsen records the recollections of many community members who saw Nelson for what she was, yet seemed oblivious to the adultery, theft and murder under their noses (Publisher's Weekly). With all new foreword by Ã¢â‚¬â€ M. William Phelps, 2011, Investigative journalist, author of 20 books, creator and star of Investigation DiscoveryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark Minds.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIF LOVING YOU IS WRONG\n\n&quot;Wonderfully researched...Searing and brilliant...A must-read!&quot;-- Ann Rule, the undisputed queen of True Crime\n\nYou know how the story ended...but do you know how it all started?\n\nWithin hours of giving birth to her sixth child, Mary Kay Letourneau had her baby daughter whisked from her arms. She was then shackled and returned to her jail cell. Just years ago, the pretty, personable Seattle schoolteacher was living a life many would envy-- she had a handsome husband, four beautiful children, and a beloved following of students. Then she was accused of child rape, and her whole world turned upside down.\n\nHow did a 34-year-old married teacher fall in love with one of her sixth-grade students? Was it a complete lapse of judgment, or-- as she contends-- the meeting of two soulmates? Were the two planning to run away together-- before police caught them in a parked car? Did the couple have illicit sex in every room of the Letourneau house, as the teenager told the tabloids? Read about the case that shocked the world and rocked the headlines-- about the lonely life of Mary Kay Letourneau and the young object of her obsession, the boy who fathered two of her children.\n\nReview: The tale seems ripe for tabloid exploitation: the fresh-faced blond elementary schoolteacher and mother of four just couldn't keep her hands off that 13-year-old boy. Worse yet, Mary Kay Letourneau had become obsessed with the slight, Samoan teenager while he was still a student in her sixth-grade class--and he fathered two babies with her. Yet in the hands of true crime writer Gregg Olsen, If Loving You Is Wrong becomes a poignant profile of an emotionally stunted young woman tightly wound up in a web of lies too fragile to sustain the weight of her own compulsions.\n\nThe facade the Letourneaus presented to the world was that of a devoted, upwardly mobile young couple. In reality Steve and Mary Kay were on the verge of financial and emotional bankruptcy. They married because she'd become pregnant and appearances were everything to Mary Kay's parents, ultra-conservative, family-values-promoting politician John Schmitz and his icy wife, Mary. Olsen, whose previous books include Abandoned Prayers and Black Widow, does a superior job with the story, interviewing Letourneau herself as well as friends and neighbors, researching and assembling the facts behind the lurid headlines in a nonjudgmental manner that allows readers to draw their own conclusions about the bigger issues at stake. Was Mary Kay Letourneau a pedophile, a child rapist, a female Humbert Humbert? Or was she, as she claims, a woman who'd found a soul mate and a true love that defied America.\n\nTAKEN IN THE NIGHT\n\nIn this exclusive ebook short, New York Times bestselling author Gregg Olsen introduces True Crime readers to the sensational kidnapping case that J. Edgar Hoover and his G-men couldn't solve -- the mystery of Tacoma's Charlie Mattson, a little boy taken in the night more than eight decades ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:952505b415ccf3bcfbfc960643bbe94a77f7cb36","amp;dn":"Sex.+Murder.+Mystery+%5BTrue+Crime+Box+Set+%5D+-+Gregg+Olsen.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"952505b415ccf3bcfbfc960643bbe94a77f7cb36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,37,5,180,21,204,243,188,251,252,150,6,67,187,233,74,119,247,203,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
