They call it &quot;Shuck It Up,&quot; and rightly so, since they're neither as dissonant nor as ironic as many of their peers playing around downtown New York City. \n\nBut that doesn't explain why these three don't swing as hard playing Monk, Coltrane, and King Sunny Ade as they do laying down their own earnest grooves and dismantling Bob Marley for mixing up with the Monk. Whether it's insecurity, indifference, or the physical chops they haven't developed to match their minds is for demanding listeners to decide. Or else it's all the same dilemma and will go away with time, just like the band's slow tunes.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Beeah\n02 - Where's Sly\n03 - Shuck It Up\n04 - Sand\n05 - Worms\n06 - Bemsha Swing-Lively Up Yourself\n07 - Moti Mo\n08 - It's A Jungle In Here\n09 - Syeeda's Song Flute\n10 - Wiggly's Way\n\n*1993 Gramavision / Rykodisc | GCD 79495\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Medeski Ã¢â‚¬â€œ organ, piano, wurlitzer\nBilly Martin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\nChris Wood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nSteven Bernstein Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trumpet, flugelhorn\nJosh Roseman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trombone\nJay Rodriguez Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor &amp; alto saxophones\nDave Binney Ã¢â‚¬â€œ alto saxophone\nMarc Ribot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\n\n\n\nSome Medeski Album's...\n\n\nMedeski, Martin &amp; Wood - Zaebos: Book of Angels Vol.11 (2008)[EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11951360/Medeski__Martin__and_Wood_-_Zaebos__Book_of_Angels_Vol.11_%282008%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11951360/Medeski__Martin__and_Wood_-_Zaebos__Book_of_Angels_Vol.11_%282008%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJohn Medeski, Matthew Shipp - Scotty Hard's Radical Reconstructive Surgery (2006) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11942272/John_Medeski__Matthew_Shipp_-_Scotty_Hard_s_Radical_Reconstructi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11942272/John_Medeski__Matthew_Shipp_-_Scotty_Hard_s_Radical_Reconstructi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMedeski, Martin &amp; Wood - Shack-Man (1996) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11936858/Medeski__Martin__amp__Wood_-_Shack-Man_%281996%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11936858/Medeski__Martin__amp__Wood_-_Shack-Man_%281996%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41156391d426f39a8d8daa47c57eae9c981b42f8","amp;dn":"Medeski%2C+Martin+%26amp%3B+Wood+-+It%27s+A+Jungle+In+Here+%281993%29+%5BEAC-F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41156391d426f39a8d8daa47c57eae9c981b42f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,21,99,145,212,38,243,154,141,141,170,71,197,126,174,156,152,27,66,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
