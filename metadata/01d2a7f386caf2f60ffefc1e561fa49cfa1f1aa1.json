The games were developed by Pyro Studios, and published by Eidos Interactive. The Macintosh version was ported by Feral Interactive.\n\nThe game places the player in command of a squad of commandos and various allies as he sneaks behind enemy lines to accomplish his objectives. The action stretches from 1941 to 1945 and takes place on both the Western Front against the Germans and the Pacific theatre against the Japanese.\n\nThe Commandos\n\nAt the beginning of each mission, the player is assigned a small number of commandos in order to complete the objectives. Each man has unique abilities and weapons.\n\n    Republic of Ireland Jack O'Hara, (The Green Beret) is the Irish sergeant with his signature codename &quot;Butcher&quot;. In the game, he is the toughest and the only commando strong enough to lift heavy loads like fuel barrels and boxes. He can also stab enemies with his knife and bury himself in most soft surfaces. He is loosely based on John Wayne's 'Green Beret'.\n\n    United Kingdom Sir Francis T. &quot;Duke&quot; Woolridge, (The Sniper) is a British operative under the name &quot;Duke&quot;. In the game, he is the team's sharpshooter.\n\n    United States Samuel Brooklyn, (The Driver) an American operative known as &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. He is the only commando who can drive tanks, set various traps and throw Molotov cocktails, stun grenades, or smoke grenades.\n\n    United Kingdom Thomas Hancock, (the Sapper) a British operative under the name &quot;Fireman&quot;. He is an expert in explosives and heavy weapons such as flamethrowers and bazookas. He is also the only commando who can fire the turret of a tank.\n\n    Australia James Blackwood, (The Marine) an Australian operative known as &quot;Fins&quot;. He can dive underwater and stay under indefinitely using his scuba gear, and is the only one who can pilot rowing boats. He can also use a grappling hook and throw knives.\n\n    France Rene Duchamp, (The Spy) a French operative known as &quot;Frenchy&quot;. He can disguise himself as any enemy soldier or officer, and can not only distract enemies, but order lower ranking ones to look a certain direction or walk to nearby places. He cannot punch out enemies, but can use a poison syringe to daze, knock-out or even kill his opponents.\n\n    Soviet Union Natasha Nikochevski, (The Seductress) is a Soviet operative from Kyiv who is known as &quot;Lips&quot;. In the game, she can distract enemy soldiers and dress as enemy operatives, but only when generals or SS are not present. She can also use a sniper rifle.\n\n    France Paul Toledo, (The Thief) a French operative known as &quot;Lupin&quot;. He is the smallest, the sneakiest and fastest, and can climb certain walls and jump through windows. He can also lockpick boxes and certain doors and knock opponents out with a roundhouse kick, but he can't tie them up.\n\nOther playable characters\n\n    Whiskey, a bull terrier dog whose owner was a member of the French resistance shot by the Nazis. He can be used to distract enemies and pass items between commandos who use a dog whistle to call him.\n    Spike, a mouse who belongs to Paul Toledo which - like Whiskey - can distract enemies.\n    Wilson, a former Royal Air Force Pilot who was shot down by the Japanese and helps the commandos by distracting enemies with his trumpet and carrying items.\n\nSystem requirements\n\n266 MHz CPU, 64 MB RAM, 5 MB video card RAM, 4X CD-ROM drive, DirectX 8.0, 1.7 GB available hard disk space, Windows 98 (WIN)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d2a7f386caf2f60ffefc1e561fa49cfa1f1aa1","amp;dn":"Commandos+2+Men+Of+Courage+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d2a7f386caf2f60ffefc1e561fa49cfa1f1aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,210,167,243,134,202,242,246,15,254,252,30,86,31,164,156,250,31,26,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
