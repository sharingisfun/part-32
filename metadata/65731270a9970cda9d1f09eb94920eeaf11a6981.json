Inspired by the Ingmar Bergman film Smiles of a Summer Night, it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for Mozart's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, Eine kleine Nachtmusik. The musical includes the popular song &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;.\n\nSince its original 1973 Broadway production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the West End, by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was adapted for film in 1977, with Harold Prince directing and Elizabeth Taylor, Len Cariou, Lesley-Anne Down and Diana Rigg starring.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65731270a9970cda9d1f09eb94920eeaf11a6981","amp;dn":"Stephen+Sondheim+-+A+Little+Night+Music+%5BV2%5D+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65731270a9970cda9d1f09eb94920eeaf11a6981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,115,18,112,169,151,12,218,157,31,9,235,148,146,14,234,241,26,105,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
