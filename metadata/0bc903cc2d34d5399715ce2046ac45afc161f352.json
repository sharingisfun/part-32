The text deals with a large class of nonlinear systems without restrictions on the system order, the number of inputs and/or outputs or the number, type or arrangement of nonlinear terms.\n\nThe strongly software-oriented methods detailed facilitate fulfillment of tight performance requirements and help the designer to think in purely nonlinear terms, avoiding the expedient of linearization which can impose substantial and unrealistic model limitations and drive up the cost of the final product.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc903cc2d34d5399715ce2046ac45afc161f352","amp;dn":"%5BNassirharand%5D+Computer-aided+Nonlinear+Control+System+Design.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc903cc2d34d5399715ce2046ac45afc161f352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,201,3,204,45,52,213,57,151,21,206,32,70,172,69,175,193,97,243,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
