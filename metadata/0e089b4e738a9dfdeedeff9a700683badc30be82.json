A wild, science fiction tale with an echo or two of Bladerunner, Casshern is set in a dystopian future following a 50-year-long war between Europe and Asia. The latter wins, calling the resulting Eurasia the &quot;Eastern Federation,&quot; but the high-tech weapons used in the battle have affected the whole of mankind through widespread devastation and illness. A geneticist whose son, Tetsuya (Yusuke Iseya), has gone off to fight terrorists, promises the military his work on &quot;neo cells&quot; will result in the cultivation of spare human parts for the wounded and afflicted. But two unexpected results occur: a small band of superhuman mutants rise up out of the scientistÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s chemical muck, and Tetsuya--killed in battle--is brought back to life with his own superpowers. While the mutants rise up against the human race, Tetsuya, now known as &quot;Casshern,&quot; takes them on against a fascinating psychological backdrop with Oedipal overtones. The filmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s look of hyperreal, pop culture pastiche (in which action often evokes the look of 1930s movie serials blended with a whirl of dreamy, free-associating images) is reaching for the same thing as Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. But it is much grander in its effort.\n\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English Hard coded\n\n*****This is the extended cut 142 min and the US version is only 117 min*****\n\ncredit jdpennington &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e089b4e738a9dfdeedeff9a700683badc30be82","amp;dn":"Casshern+DvDRip+XviD-JDP+%28Director+Cut%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e089b4e738a9dfdeedeff9a700683badc30be82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,8,155,78,115,138,157,253,238,222,255,154,112,6,131,186,220,48,190,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
