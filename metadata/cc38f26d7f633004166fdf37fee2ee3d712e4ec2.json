Gossling a.k.a. singer/songwriter Helen Croome, has crafted a 10-track gem filled with distinctive and dreamy vocals and a wonderfully produced sound that combines touches of electronica and confident percussion with whimsical harps and guitar, that give the album a glittery, retro-meets-pop quality.\n\nWe open with Big Love, a controlled and delicate beginning with CroomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty, childlike vocals luring the listener in, before big percussion and synth open up the track with a lush poppy chorus. The wonderfully thoughtful lyrics are like a flowing waterfall in this track. Asks Croome: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What are we made of, big or little love?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe title track begins with ominous marching percussion and features some ridiculously catchy hooks. The song has potential to be a massive commercial success for Gossling, with its alluring undertone. Meanwhile, Never Expire is packed with attitude and honest lyrics that tell the story of a love falling apart: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Talking of faults, shifting blame from yourself / Caught in a mess of words when you try lying as helpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but think who mightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve inspired this song and its expressions of pain.\n\n\nSongs Of Summer is a gorgeous, laid-back track co-written with Steve Parkin (Basement Birds) and features SparkadiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alex Burnett. Themes of love and heartbreak continue, as the lyrics tell of a love that slowly crumbled, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where did we go? Where did our songs of summer go?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she asks. The track is musically reminiscent of Kylie Minogue and Nick CaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duet Where the Wild Roses Grow, possessing similarly vulnerable, haunting vocals and slow and steady percussion.\n\nVanish is a very interesting and melancholy track when taking into account the context. Written in the wake of the murder of Jill Meagher, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an incredibly intimate and personal piece of music. Croome told record label Dew Process:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I was angry for a long timeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I was affected by the fact that we saw some of her last moments. It was good it was put out there, but it also felt wrong, intrusive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe lyrics are incredibly heartfelt and provoke such raw emotion, commenting on what many MelbornianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s might have been thinking in response to the tragedy: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hasten my walk and I worry, has my safety been what I thought? / Look over my shoulder, straight away sorry, my heart is on rapidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The track has an eerie, industrial feel to it, while maintaining a simplicity to allow the lyrics to grab onto the listener. The lyrics end truthfully and thoughtfully: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The streets stay the same, but now we all know her name.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe track Challenge has a retro, disco vibe and contains lengthy, whimsical hooks that show off CroomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delicate and sweet-sounding vocals. Though occasionally, the length of the hooks and their resemblance to each other make the track slightly repetitive.\n\nPulse has an interesting sound and possesses a vulnerable and haunting quality, much like Vanish, but is more theatrical due to the deep percussion and CroomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high tones. The cryptic lyrics add to the mystery of the track, setting apart from other songs on the album. We close on a calming, almost hypnotic note with A LoversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Spat.\n\nHarvest Of Gold is a stunning debut album. The lyrics are honest and heartfelt and seem to come from a real place of wisdom. The arrangements and melodies on each track have been expertly produced and create an air of gracefulness present throughout the album, a gracefulness which is also heard in CroomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautifully distinctive vocals. GosslingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album is a delight on every level....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc38f26d7f633004166fdf37fee2ee3d712e4ec2","amp;dn":"Gossling+-+Harvest+of+Gold+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc38f26d7f633004166fdf37fee2ee3d712e4ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,56,242,109,127,99,48,4,22,111,223,55,254,226,238,61,113,46,78,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
