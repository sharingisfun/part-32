Between their similar instances, this band of eight local musicians comes front and their third album, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Art-istÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ adds a new dimension to their flawless performances. While each member of the band keeps on performing at the top level, deciding to add guest musicians to the project, and tasting their effects to the album are really something important. The essence from the masters such as HÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼snÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾enlendirici and Ercan Irmak from the East side is priceless. On the other hand, the songs with the contributions of the girl-band Candy Rock from thesinger Sharone Eliya from Israel, and Boy George who is one of the icons of 1980s, show us the unity of feelings of different worlds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74909287105886c54dc06af0b7675aad3741e6c","amp;dn":"Dolapdere+-+Art-Ist+%5BBrotherCharlie%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74909287105886c54dc06af0b7675aad3741e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,73,9,40,113,5,136,108,84,220,6,175,11,118,117,170,211,116,30,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
