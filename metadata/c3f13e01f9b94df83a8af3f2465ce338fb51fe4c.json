Shows you how to express yourself the way you always wanted without sounding too grammatical.\n\n\nCover to the book is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sefersafari.com/0804833966.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sefersafari.com/0804833966.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHey I liked this book a lot. One of the first ones I bought when I moved to Honolulu, Hawaii back in the early 90&amp;#039;s, and it helped me meet my wife, who is from Kobe... (who&amp;#039;s still my wife)...\n\nSo, the one liners are helpful, and accurate .. of course you need more than just these, but they&amp;#039;re a great place to start, and easy to learn. Great format and interesting to read.\n\nFunny writing, clever and interesting..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f13e01f9b94df83a8af3f2465ce338fb51fe4c","amp;dn":"japanese+%28Making+Out+In+Japanese%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f13e01f9b94df83a8af3f2465ce338fb51fe4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,241,62,1,249,185,77,248,58,138,243,242,70,92,227,56,251,81,254,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
