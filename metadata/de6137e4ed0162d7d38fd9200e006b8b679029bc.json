Reseeded. Confirmed working!\n\n1) Burn the image or mount it on a virtual drive. You can even try WinRar to unpack the isofile (then use the extracted Start.exe).\n2) Run the installer. No serial or whatsover required.\n3) On youre desktop an icon has been placed (AeroSelect). Run this BEFORE fireup FS2004!\n4) Done? Start FS2004 and find these nice props via &amp;#039;Aircrafts&amp;#039; - &quot;JF-Club&quot;.\n\nRemember: what goes up, goes always down.
