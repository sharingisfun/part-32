There are strong ramifications if things go awry. Things will go wrong if they can, and hence we see a salvo of attacks that have continued to disrupt the normal scheme of things in our day to day lives. This book will guide you on how to use essential tools such as debuggers, disassemblers, and sandboxes to dissect malware samples. It will expose your innards and then build a report of their indicators of compromise along with detection rule sets that will enable you to help contain the outbreak when faced with such a situation.\n\nWe will start with the basics of computing fundamentals such as number systems and Boolean algebra. Further, you'll learn about x86 assembly programming and its integration with high level languages such as C++.You'll understand how to decipher disassembly code obtained from the compiled source code and map it back to its original design goals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5d50ce334e97dbbb0926b456b7d7ca5f2b67eca","amp;dn":"Windows+Malware+Analysis+Essentials+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5d50ce334e97dbbb0926b456b7d7ca5f2b67eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,213,12,227,52,233,125,187,176,146,107,69,107,125,124,165,242,182,126,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
