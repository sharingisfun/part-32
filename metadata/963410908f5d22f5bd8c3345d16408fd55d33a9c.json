At the deadline, in 1938, another Gracie Alden, the last girl of the line, is having trouble with her studies, so she hires fast-talking Bud Brady (Bob Hope) to help her. Her efforts are opposed by woman-hating professor Hubert Dash (Edward Everett Horton) and his secretary George Jones (George Burns), who don't want to see their beloved college fall into the hands of an empty-headed nit-wit like Gracie.\n\nWhen by hook and by crook Gracie manages to pass her exam and becomes the owner of the college, she does away with entrance exams, hires a bunch of incompetent but kooky teachers, and turns the place into a jumpin' jitterbugging joint complete with swing bands and remote radio broadcasts.\n\n==================================================================\nBob Hope Tribute Collection - Big Broadcast of 1938 - W.C.Fields, Martha Raye [DDR]\n\nThe Big Broadcast of 1938 is a Paramount Pictures film featuring W.C.

Gigantic (Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Challenge for Crossing RecordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is about to race its rival, the slightly smaller S.S. Colossal across the Atlantic from New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pier 97 to Cherbourg in two-and-a-half days. Gigantic owner T. Frothingill Ã¢â‚¬Å“T.F.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bellows (W.C. Fields) intends to send his nearly identical younger brother S.B. (also Fields) to sail aboard the Colossal, hoping he will cause trouble and sabotage the rival ship, enabling the Gigantic and his own Bellows Line to win.\n\nHowever S.B., who is held back due to a golf game, ends up flying over the ocean to meet the Colossal en route and mistakenly lands aboard the deck of the Gigantic instead, much to the consternation of Captain Stafford (Russell Hicks). Matters are made worse for the Gigantic when S.B.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s outrageously unlucky daughter Martha (Martha Raye) is brought onboard, being rescued after surviving the shipwreck of the yacht, Hesperus V.\n\nPopular OBC radio emcee Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope), who has just been released from Ã¢â‚¬Å“alimony jailÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and is broadcasting live from the Gigantic, is trying to juggle his three ex-wives Cleo (Shirley Ross), Grace (Grace Bradley), and Joan (Lorna Gray); his lukewarm girlfriend Dorothy Wyndham (Dorothy Lamour); and his inept microphone assistant Mike (Ben Blue). Buzz does his best throughout the voyage to announce the progress of the race and introduce a series of musical acts for the pleasure of the passengers and OBCÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s radio audience.\n\nMeanwhile Dorothy is romanced by First Officer (and inventor of the GiganticÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enormous radio power plant) Robert Hayes (Leif Erickson), just as Buzz and Joan get sentimental about their broken marriage.\n\nSONG NUMBERS:\n&quot;This Little Ripple Had Rhythm,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ instrumental piece performed Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra, with integrated cartoon segments.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Tell a Secret to a RoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Spanish lyrics to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zuni ZuniÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (called Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the film) sung by Tito GuÃƒÂ­zar, with GuÃƒÂ­zar playing Spanish guitar on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zuni Zuni.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“You Took the Words Right Out of My HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung by Dorothy Lamour and Leif Erickson\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“BrunnhildeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Battle CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (from Richard WagnerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Die Walkure, Act 2 Scene 1) performed by Metropolitan Opera soprano Madame Kirsten Flagstad with an orchestra conducted by Wilfrid Pelletier.\nComedy performance by Bob Hope, Ben Blue and Patricia Wilder; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Way Down South in Dixie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung a cappella by Patricia Wilder.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart (reprise)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung by Dorothy Lamour.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Thanks for the MemoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Mama, That Moon is Here AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ song and slapstick dance performed by Martha Raye and dancers.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Waltz Lives On,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung by Bob Hope, Shirley Ross and chorus.
