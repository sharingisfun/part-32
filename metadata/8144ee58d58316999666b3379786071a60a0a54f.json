It was originally published by Wildstorm before moving to Dynamite Entertainment\n\nThe series is set in a contemporary world very much similar to real one, with one notable exception: a number of people have some form of superpower. The series follows a superpowered CIA squad, known informally as &quot;the Boys&quot;, whose job it is to keep watch on superheroes and, if necessary, intimidate or kill them.\n\nEnnis has said that the series will &quot;out-Preacher Preacher&quot; [1], presumably referring to the extreme violence and sexuality that were that series&amp;#039; hallmark. He has also stated that he expects the series to last for approximately 60 issues.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/The_Boys_-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/The_Boys_-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8144ee58d58316999666b3379786071a60a0a54f","amp;dn":"Garth+Ennis%5C%27+The+Boys+%231+-+%2319+Current+as+of+June+08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8144ee58d58316999666b3379786071a60a0a54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,68,238,88,213,131,22,153,150,102,179,55,151,134,7,26,96,160,165,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
