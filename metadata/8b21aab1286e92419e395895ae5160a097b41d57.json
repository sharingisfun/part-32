They will embark on a 12 day epic mission like no other. Only the courageous will survive this brutal expedition to the very end. They must trek over treacherous mountains, find and eat wild food, build shelter and make fire as they navigate their way to the coastline and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5)  Part 5 \r\nAfter eight days in the wild, the physical strain is taking its toll on the four remaining celebrities - but they know a place in the final is within reach. For their first task, they split into two teams and build rafts to get them safely across an estuary. However, the tide is coming in and with it the danger of a shark attack. Once across they each have to build their own shelter, to demonstrate what they have learnt from their experience, and are shocked by Bear's demonstration of how to stay hydrated when there is no clean water available. Will they take up the challenge to repeat his very personal method or walk?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3138 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/mission-survive/251813-mission-survive-2016-cast-revealed-meet-celebrity-contestants.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b21aab1286e92419e395895ae5160a097b41d57","amp;dn":"Bear+Grylls+Mission+Survive+Series+2+5of6+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b21aab1286e92419e395895ae5160a097b41d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,33,170,177,40,110,146,65,158,57,88,149,174,81,96,160,151,180,29,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
