It begins with their very first XM show on September 12th, 2005, and ends with the last show of 2012 (I only seed complete years, so I will seed 2013 when the year is over).\n\nI will be seeding these shows year by year, and some years contain more shows than others.  For instance, 2005 and 2006 are very sparse, only averaging a dozen or so shows.  Then we start getting hardcore, with hundreds of shows.  2009 peaks at 263 shows.  Here is a list of the number of shows by year along with the size of the torrent:\n\n2005: 8 shows (602 MB)\n2006: 13 shows (800 MB)\n2007: 144 shows (10.2 GB)\n2008: 255 shows (17.9 GB)\n2009: 263 shows (22.7 GB)\n2010: 253 shows (23.2 GB)\n2011: 232 shows (21.1 GB)\n2012: 246 shows (32.2 GB)\n\n(All MP3s are are properly tagged and encoded at 64kbps to save space due to the length of the shows - it is mostly talking anyway) \n\nI make no claims that this is a complete Ron and Fez collection or that every single show is complete, but I can say that there is enough Ron and Fez here to listen to for a VERY long time (over 100 gigs worth in total).  If you are planning on downloading multiple torrents, simply point each torrent to download to the top level folder (&quot;Ron &amp; Fez SiriusXM Shows&quot;) and the individual years will download to their own subfolders (for some clients you must point to one level above the top level folder).  \n\nThe only downside to this is that the name of each torrent may appear the same in your BT client (depending on the client).  This is necessary, however, to keep the folder structure I want as this will be a series of torrents with subfolders.  You can see which year a torrent is by clicking the Files tab for each torrent.  \n\nThe shows were all downloaded courtesy of SpreadTheOnAVirus.com at http://www.spreadtheonavirus.com.  Many, many thanks to person who runs this site.  Amazing work, you da man.\n\n-devoidzer0, 2013-08-17 (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;137776657c7a776976617c53747e727a7f3d707c7e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d35f87b53bcf822cfdf5c9ea403c09fb6dc280","amp;dn":"Ron+and+Fez+SiriusXM+Shows+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d35f87b53bcf822cfdf5c9ea403c09fb6dc280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,211,95,135,181,59,207,130,44,253,245,201,234,64,60,9,251,109,194,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
