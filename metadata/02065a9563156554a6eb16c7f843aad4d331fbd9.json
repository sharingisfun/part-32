With a stifling and musically limiting Calgary club scene they were never able to get farther than having one single -- 1966's &quot;All Your Love&quot;. The tune would eventually pop up on a (now rare) 4 song EP next to an early incarnation of The Stampeders.\n\nAs members came and went a name change was introduced as 49th Parallel and over the course of a year a solid line-up developed featuring Abbott, Lowe, Carlson, Petch, Woodhouse and Bare.\n\nThe group released three singles on Gaeity Records between mid-1967 and late spring of 1968, at which time Petch and Woodhouse left and Dave Downey was added as bassist (Petch was not replaced).\n\nThroughout 1968 and parts of 1969 they toured throughout North America with an ever fluctuating roster. Despite these shake ups, they did hit and run recording sessions which bore several singles for Venture Records including &quot;Twilight Woman&quot; that managed seven weeks on the CHUM charts with a peak position of #16 in April 1969, and its follow-up, &quot;Now That I'm A Man&quot;, in September 1969 which managed a modest 3 week ride on the CHUM charts and a peak position of #22.\n\nA full-length album was hastily assembled from singles and studio outtakes because the line-up was continually fluctuating and new recordings were impossible to conduct. This would be compounded by the immediate departure of singer Dennis Abbott following the album's released.\n\nEnter Dorn Beattie, who, along with Lowe, Velker, Downey and Bare began working on another album in 1970 which was never completed, though the single, &quot;I Need You&quot;, did surface (and failed to chart).\n\nEventually the band changed its name to Painter and released one album before mutating into the hard rock act Hammersmith who would finally succumb in the late '70's after two albums on Mercury Records.\n\nBeattie went on to create All The Rage In Paris, but that too faltered when co-founding keyboardist Doug Johnson quit to form Loverboy. Beattie, in recent years, is now a successful country singer; Lowe continued on with a new version of Painter, 451 Degrees, and Prototype (who also recorded an album). He produced albums by Qwest, Whitewolf, George Fox, Amin Bhatia, and would also be responsible for the invention of the studio production technique called Q-Sound (used by such luminaries as Pink Floyd, Bob Ezrin and Madonna)\n\n49th Parallel found a mild revival in the mid-90's on classic rock radio in the prairies, prompting Pacemaker Records to issue a 'best of' collection. \n\nSingles\nas SHADES OF BLOND\n1966 All Your Love\n\nas 49th PARALLEL\n1967 Labourer/You Do Things (Gaiety)\n\n1968 She Says/Citizen Freak (Gaiety)\n1968 Blue Bonnie Blue/Missouri (Gaiety)\n\n1969 Twilight Woman (Venture)\n1969 Now That I'm A Man (Venture)\n\n1970 I Need You/Goodtime Baby (Venture)\n\nAlbums/CDs\n1969 49th Parallel (Gaiety)\n\n1995 The Best Of 49th Parallel (Pacemaker)\n\nCompilations\n1999 &quot;Citizen Freak&quot; on 'Best Of Gaeity Records' (Pacemaker)\n\n\n\n49th Parallel / (The Best Of) 49th Parallel 1995\nTrack Title\t\n1.Labourer\t \n2.You Do Things\t \n3.Citizen Freak\t \n4.She Says\t \n5.Blue Bonnie Blue\t \n6.Up To No Good\t \n7.Now That I'm A Man\t \n8.Get Away\t \n9.Eye To Eye\t \n10.Missouri\t \n11.Lazerander Filcny\t \n12.(Come On Little Child) Talk To Me\t \n13.Magician\t \n14.Twilight Woman\t \n15.Close The Barn Door\t \n16.The People\t \n17.Good Time Baby\t \n18.I Need You\t \n19.Shades Of Blond/All Your Love\n\nPacemaker PACE019","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02065a9563156554a6eb16c7f843aad4d331fbd9","amp;dn":"49th+Parallel+-+The+Best+Of+1967-1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02065a9563156554a6eb16c7f843aad4d331fbd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,6,90,149,99,21,101,84,166,235,22,199,248,67,170,212,211,49,251,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
