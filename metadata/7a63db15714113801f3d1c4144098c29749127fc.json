Los Angeles-based DJ Jim Ladd's aptly titled Inner View was the first nationally syndicated music and interview program to raise the intelligence bar several notches. Ladd's No One Here Gets Out Alive -- originally broadcast on North American radio stations during the late summer of 1979 -- is an audio biography of the Doors as told by those who lived it. This show marks the first time that John Densmore, Robbie Krieger, and Ray Manzarek spoke candidly regarding the band's origins and their even more colorful lyricist, Jim Morrison. Ladd's narration guides listeners through a profile that is as much sociological as it is historical or musical. This results in an engaging listen for new recruits as well as those familiar with the folklore surrounding the Doors and their craft. In addition to providing a more or less chronological history of the band, each disc examines a specific motif found within the Doors' music. The songs substantiate the revealing interview sound bites between Ladd, the surviving Doors, their band manager Bill Siddons, and concert promoter Bill &quot;Uncle Bobo&quot; Graham, as well as band confidant and author Danny Sugerman. There is no padding or filler on No One Here Gets Out Alive, making the three-hour running time seem infinitely shorter. There is a caveat regarding the source material for No One Here Gets Out Alive. This set was mastered from vinyl. While this in no way affects the sound quality or listenability, astute consumers will inevitably notice intermittent surface noise intrinsic to the playback medium. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a63db15714113801f3d1c4144098c29749127fc","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+No+One+Here+Gets+Out+Alive+%282001%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a63db15714113801f3d1c4144098c29749127fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,99,219,21,113,65,19,128,31,61,28,65,68,9,140,41,116,145,39,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
