Forever and Ever is one of three books left unpublished when Savitri Devi died in 1982. The manuscript was long thought to be lost. But in 2006, a French friend of Savitri contacted the Savitri Devi Archive with the news that all three volumes were extant. Forever and Ever is the first of Savitri Devi's long-awaited posthumous works to be published. This volume also includes an additional poem, &quot;In Memory of May 1st, 1945,&quot; written in 1946 by Clara Sharland, which is probably a pen name of Savitri Devi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d209b7903e2e51233b8a2d867efafe0cfab4478b","amp;dn":"Forever+and+Ever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d209b7903e2e51233b8a2d867efafe0cfab4478b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,9,183,144,62,46,81,35,59,138,45,134,126,250,254,12,250,180,71,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
