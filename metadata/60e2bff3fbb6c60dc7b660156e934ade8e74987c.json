Even if what he says is not directly relevant to one's own situation, he writes in such a way as one can see how he is looking at it, and so draw a guideline. These comments have the touch of a master. Jou includes the Chinese. In his translation he does not depart greatly from Wilhelm, though I am sure he is quite capable of making a few improvements. The introduction includes a version of the yarrow stalk ritual I have seen nowhere else, and a description of the Plum Blossom method. Also a treatment of the phases of the moon in terms of yin and yang. An excellent work reflecting a modern Chinese approach.
