Consisting of 3182 alliterative long lines and set in Scandinavia, it is the oldest surviving epic poem of Old English and the earliest vernacular English literature.\n\nIn the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geats in Scandinavia, comes to the aid of HroÃƒÂ°gar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall (in Heorot) has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel.  After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated.  Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats.  After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is fatally wounded in the battle.  After his death, his attendants bury him in a tumulus, a burial mound, in Geatland.\n\nOf particular importance is Seamus Heaney's bilingual edition of the poem (referred to by Howell Chickering and many others as &quot;Heaneywulf&quot;).  J. R. R. Tolkien's long-awaited translation and commentary (edited by his son Christopher) was published in May 2014.\n\n\nThe following books are a mixture of PDF or ePUB/MOBI formats:\n\n* BEOWULF: A NEW VERSE TRANSLATION (Norton, 2000).  Bilingual edition.  Translated by Seamus Heaney. -- PDF\n\n* BEOWULF: AN UPDATED VERSE TRANSLATION (HarperPerennial, 2004).
