Here, three tales unfold. Each tale features a person who is dying. Each person is surrounded by loved ones. All are trying to face and make sense of death.\n \nThe first family we meet is the most conventional. Joe (James Broderick), a working class husband and father, is joined at the cottage by his wife Maggie (Valerie Harper), who, in denial of JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impending death is afraid to enter the cottage. Their son, Steve, age 14, has not yet been told of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terminal condition. The second family consists of Brian (Christopher Plummer), who is brutally forthright about his demise, Mark (Ben Masters), his doting lover and Beverly (Joanne Woodward), BrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s free-spirited ex-wife who comes to visit them. The third family is a feisty, wheelchair-bound mother, Felicity (Sylvia Sydney), and her dutiful daughter, Agnes (Melinda Dillon).\n \nBased on The Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning play by Michael Cristofer, this 1980 Tv Movie adaptation was directed by Paul Newman and was the winner of the Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV&quot; that year as well as several Emmy nominations.\n\n\nVideo \nDVDRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream \nCodec ID : XVID \nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 1h 43mn \nBit rate : 1 779 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.232 \nStream size : 1.29 GiB (93%) \nWriting library : XviD 73 \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nMode : Joint stereo \nMode extension : MS Stereo \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 1h 43mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 95.0 MiB (7%) \nAlignment : Split accross interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57225c307e3f76d0c6e598b5285bfe952b459724","amp;dn":"The+Shadow+Box+%281980%29+DVDRip+-+Rare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57225c307e3f76d0c6e598b5285bfe952b459724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,34,92,48,126,63,118,208,198,229,152,181,40,91,254,149,43,69,151,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
