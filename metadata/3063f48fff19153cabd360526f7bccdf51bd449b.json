This was the band's last show of its three-leg 2000 tour. The band performed at this show for over three hours, playing most of its hits along with selected cover songs such as &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; and &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; by The Who, one of Pearl Jam's biggest musical influences. This show also featured the North American tour's first performance of &quot;Alive&quot;, which had been purposely omitted from all shows on the tour.\n\nThis show was selected by the band as one of 18 &quot;Ape/Man&quot; shows from the tour, which, according to bassist Jeff Ament, were shows the band found &quot;really exciting.&quot; Allmusic called the show an &quot;essential live document,&quot; and gave it four and a half out of a possible five stars. Allmusic reviewer Douglas Siwek said that &quot;by the time they hit their hometown of Seattle in November 2000, it was obvious that the band was truly in sync musically.&quot; It debuted at number 98 on the Billboard 200 album chart and was the highest charting official bootleg out of the entire series. &quot;Leatherman&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, &quot;Nothingman&quot;, &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot;, and &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; from this show appear on the Touring Band 2000 DVD.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEddie Vedder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitars, ukulele \nStone Gossard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars \nMike McCready ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars \nJeff Ament ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, design concept \nMatt Cameron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \nJustine Foy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cello \nApril Cameron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ viola \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3063f48fff19153cabd360526f7bccdf51bd449b","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+LIVE+11%2F06%2F2000+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Seattle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3063f48fff19153cabd360526f7bccdf51bd449b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,99,244,143,255,25,21,60,171,211,96,82,111,123,204,223,81,189,68,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
