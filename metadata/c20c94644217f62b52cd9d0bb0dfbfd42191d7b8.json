In 1977 they switched to a Christian rock format. They continued to sing and record together through 1999. Recording and performing together for almost 40 years, the band released 17 albums. Though the band's style has been compared to that of Mylon LeFevre and Broken Heart, their most commercially successful work came in the 1960s with a sound, augmented by The Muscle Shoals Horns, that closely resembled that of Jay And The Techniques.\n\nIn Christ,\nTorrentTracts - September 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c20c94644217f62b52cd9d0bb0dfbfd42191d7b8","amp;dn":"David+And+The+Giants+Discography+1981-1996+%2813+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c20c94644217f62b52cd9d0bb0dfbfd42191d7b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,12,148,100,66,23,246,43,82,205,157,11,176,223,191,212,33,145,215,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
