Basically, that means text will be easier to read because the letters and words won&amp;#039;t be as soft and mushy looking.\n\nThe Microsoft collection includes two serif, four sans serif, and a monospaced face for use in programming environments. They are intended to be text typefaces as opposed to display faces that are used in larger sizes for headlines. Some of the new fonts are suitable for print as well as on-screen applications.\n\nSuggested substitutions:\n\nTahoma -&gt; Segoe UI\nCourier -&gt; Consolas\nArial/Verdana -&gt; Calibri\nTimes New Roman -&gt; Cambria\n\nRead more:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adobe.co.uk/type/opentype/main.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adobe.co.uk/type/opentype/main.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f435248b433128561ecca2e36ecacb4e80926010","amp;dn":"Microsoft+ClearType+Fonts+%28optimized+for+LCDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f435248b433128561ecca2e36ecacb4e80926010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,53,36,139,67,49,40,86,30,204,162,227,110,202,203,78,128,146,96,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
