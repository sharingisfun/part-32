If you entered the code correctly, you will hear a sound.\n4- DOSbox emulates DOS environment, so the game may run slow (it ran fine in my i7-930 CPU + GT470 GPU). If this happens reduce screen resolution in nGlide Configurator.\n\nInstructions obtained from:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://atombomb.no-ip.org/blog/2010/12/10/how-to-play-carmageddon-and-splat-pack-with-3dfx-emulation-in-high-resolution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://atombomb.no-ip.org/blog/2010/12/10/how-to-play-carmageddon-and-splat-pack-with-3dfx-emulation-in-high-resolution/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a12b6e057eae913e212cf21e3df133ed531d674","amp;dn":"Carmageddon+3DFX+-+quick+play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a12b6e057eae913e212cf21e3df133ed531d674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,18,182,224,87,234,233,19,226,18,207,33,227,223,19,62,213,49,214,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
