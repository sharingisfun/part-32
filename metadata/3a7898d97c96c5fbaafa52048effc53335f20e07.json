It was released in mono and stereo versions. The album was also issued in Germany on the Odeon label.\n\nIn 2004, it was released on CD for the first time as part of The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 box set (catalogue number CDP 7243 8 66874 2 5). In 2014, the album was released on CD again, individually and included in the Beatles boxed set The U.S. Albums.\n\nIn the US the album was a blockbuster hit, and jumped from No. 98 straight to No. 1, making the biggest jump to the top position in the history of the Billboard Album Charts up to that time. It remained at number one for nine straight weeks from 9 January 1965. Beatles '65 was the top selling non-soundtrack album based on Billboard's year end chart for 1965. \n\nIn what may be testament to the overwhelming market appeal of the Beatles , several albums were released and promoted in America during 1965 sporting a similar title. These included Sinatra '65 by Frank Sinatra and Ellington '65 by Duke Ellington on Reprise Records, Trio '65 by jazz pianist Bill Evans on Verve Records, and Brasil '65 by SÃƒÂ©rgio Mendes on the Beatles' own Capitol label.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01. \t&quot;No Reply&quot;   \tJohn with Paul \t2:15\n02. \t&quot;I'm a Loser&quot;   \tJohn with Paul \t2:31\n03. \t&quot;Baby's in Black&quot;   \tJohn and Paul \t2:02\n04. \t&quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (Chuck Berry) \tJohn \t2:32\n05. \t&quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot;   \tPaul \t1:46\n06. \t&quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; (Roy Lee Johnson) \tJohn \t2:35\n07. \t&quot;Honey Don't&quot; (Carl Perkins) \tRingo \t2:56\n08. \t&quot;I'll Be Back&quot;   \tJohn and Paul \t2:22\n09. \t&quot;She's a Woman&quot; (Duophonic Mix) \tPaul \t2:57\n10. \t&quot;I Feel Fine&quot; (Duophonic Mix) \tJohn with Paul \t2:20\n11. \t&quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby&quot; (Carl Perkins) George 2:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7898d97c96c5fbaafa52048effc53335f20e07","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+The+Beatles%27+65+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7898d97c96c5fbaafa52048effc53335f20e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,120,152,217,124,150,197,251,170,250,82,4,142,255,197,51,53,242,14,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
