With Asia's economy and population booming, what changes will Julian detect from previous visits? Julian's journey begins rather inauspiciously in Hong Kong, where he foolishly volunteers to take one of Bruce Lee's famed one-inch punches at a martial arts school. After a sudden necessity to visit the bathroom shortly thereafter, it's at least a lesson learned. In Thailand, Julian tags along with investigative journalists and is recruited as an undercover spy to film an exposÃ© on illegal gambling. Once again Julian finds he might have got himself in a little deeper than he would have liked, another lesson learned. Typically, whenever Julian is involved, there appears to be a pattern forming. Subsequent visits to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and China also offer lots more education for Julian. Let's just say Julian is a great student of world travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7)  China \r\nHeading to the economic powerhouse of China, Julian Hanton finds a country in transition. In Beijing he indulges in some local delicacies, tasting peking duck, silkworm and scorpion. After a hike on the Great Wall he gets locked in a room with some high school girls in a real life puzzle game. In X'ian he lays eyes on the amazing Terracotta warriors before attending class at a local school. In the futuristic city of Shanghai, Julian finds himself a hit at Love Square, before ending his trip in Thames Town, a suburb of Shanghai that looks more like a slice of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3152 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 7\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.01 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv.nu/program/asian-times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf26b86c28a6d6a54f5bbf1b281a43baa14dd57","amp;dn":"Asian+Times+Series+1+7of7+China+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf26b86c28a6d6a54f5bbf1b281a43baa14dd57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,242,107,134,194,138,109,106,84,245,187,241,178,129,164,59,170,20,221,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
