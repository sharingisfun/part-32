Kenny (from ?Masters At Work?) says that Hector taught him most of what he knows about Latin music -- and you can bet that with a credential like that, the selection of cuts on the set far surpasses the standard compilation of Latin grooves! The groove here is prime mid 70s salsa -- and Torres does an excellent job of sorting through 70s albums that may get lost in the shuffle, but which include some very nice cuts that often get overlooked because the album itself isn&amp;#039;t a total standout.\n\n\n\n01.
