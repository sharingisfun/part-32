Kibako spans from extended and powerful harsh noise pieces to ambient and tribal offerings. Once again Merzbow is able to surprise us, this time with tribal wooden instruments, violent analogue synths and ambient soundscapes. The music of Kibako represents a vision of sound and concepts presented in a way only the mind of a world class master of noise could deliver. Powerful sound and ambient tribalism battle for the ears attention. \n\nThe track &quot;Operation Musashi&quot; was previously released on the compilation album No Red Seas. \n\nTracklist:\n\nCD 1 \t\n\n1.
