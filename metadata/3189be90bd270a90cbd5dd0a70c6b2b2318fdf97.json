This was the first album Davis recorded with Gil Evans, with whom he would go on to release albums like Porgy and Bess and Sketches of Spain. Gil Evans combined the ten pieces that make up the album in a kind of suite, each following the preceding one without interruption. Davis is the only soloist on Miles Ahead, which also features a prominent horn section.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1. &quot;Springsville&quot; (Carisi) \n2. &quot;The Maids of Cadiz&quot; (Delibes) \n3. &quot;The Duke&quot; (Dave Brubeck) \n4. &quot;My Ship&quot; (Gershwin/Weill) \n5. &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; (Davis/Evans) \n6. &quot;Blues for Pablo&quot; (Evans) \n7. &quot;New Rhumba&quot; (Jamal) \n8. &quot;The Meaning of the Blues&quot; (Troup/Worth) \n9. &quot;Lament&quot; (J.J.
