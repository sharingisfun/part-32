Designed to support Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), these materials provide a variety of ways to promote a student-focused, active classroom that range from cooperative learning to active student participation in a more traditional setting. They are designed to train students to use and analyze data, figures, and text to deduce chemical concepts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97dd084cfad627e8f41dde46bb904c7257e804c1","amp;dn":"Chemistry%3A+A+Guided+Inquiry%2C+4th+Edition+%287Summits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97dd084cfad627e8f41dde46bb904c7257e804c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,221,8,76,250,214,39,232,244,29,222,70,187,144,76,114,87,232,4,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
