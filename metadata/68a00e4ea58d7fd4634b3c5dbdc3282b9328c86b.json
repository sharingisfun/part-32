Where Emmerdale studied an introverted melancholy, Life is undiminished in both its independent-minded exuberance (&quot;Hey! Get Out of My Way&quot;) and zest to enjoy life with others (&quot;Daddy's Car,&quot; &quot;Gordon's Gardenparty&quot;). The incredible production and quality of arrangement from the debut are here also, even more strikingly crisp and spot-on. (Over 50 instruments were used on the 14 songs included on the Minty Fresh American release.) Though the Cardigans planned Life as something of a joke, it became one of the finest pop albums of the '90s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68a00e4ea58d7fd4634b3c5dbdc3282b9328c86b","amp;dn":"The+Cardigans+-+Life+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68a00e4ea58d7fd4634b3c5dbdc3282b9328c86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,160,14,78,165,141,127,212,99,75,60,93,189,195,40,43,147,40,200,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
