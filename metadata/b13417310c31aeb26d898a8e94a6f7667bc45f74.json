TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve one hit record (&quot;Love Me Do&quot;) behind them and the next (&quot;Please Please Me&quot;) primed for release, their first album session is booked, and America is clear on the horizon.

Here is the complete and true account of their family lives, childhoods, teenage years and their infatuation with American music, here is the riveting narrative of their unforgettable days and nights in the Cavern Club, their laughs, larks and adventures when they could move about freely, before fame closed in.  \n\nFor those whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never read a Beatles book before, this is the place to discover the young men behind the icons. For those who think they know John, Paul, George, and Ringo, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to press the Reset button and tune into the real story, the lasting word.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13417310c31aeb26d898a8e94a6f7667bc45f74","amp;dn":"Tune+In+-+The+Beatles+All+These+Years++%5BVolume+1%5D+-+Mark+Lewisoh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13417310c31aeb26d898a8e94a6f7667bc45f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,52,23,49,12,49,174,178,109,137,138,142,148,166,247,102,123,196,95,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
