The sound is fantastic and the camera work is as well. Recorded live in front of 250,000 screaming fans this is Maiden at their best. In an age when most like shows are nothing more than lip synched dance party (Brittney Spears, n&amp;#039;synch, backstreet boys etc.) B.S. where the actual music is nothing more than an after thought, Maiden show what real musicians can do in a live atmosphere. Playing songs that span their 30+ year career these guys show no signs of slowing down. Bruce sounds great, Dave,Adrian and Janick all play their hearts out and unlike most of the bands that have popped up in the last 10 years Maiden plays quality guitar solos. Steve Harris is without a doubt one of the worlds best songwriter/bassists and as far as drummers go Nicko can&amp;#039;t be touched. If you&amp;#039;re a Maiden fan or metal fan, this is a must see/hear. Up the Irons!!! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93b0c4d9ee090a0171d2c01494ecb8c55be02c7","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Rock+in+Rio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93b0c4d9ee090a0171d2c01494ecb8c55be02c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,59,12,77,158,224,144,160,23,29,44,1,73,78,203,140,85,190,2,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
