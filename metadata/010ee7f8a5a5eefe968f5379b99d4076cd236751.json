This delightful anthology presents some of the funniest extracts in English literature. David Timson starts with Anglo-Saxon riddles and continues with medieval memories, Tudor comic turns and Restoration buffoonery. The rise of the novel in the eighteenth century brought classic humour from Swift, Sterne and Smollet, passing the mantle to Charles Dickens in the nineteenth century. Included here are rarities as well, from the antiquarian's cupboard. There are also excerpts from children's literature and twentieth-century classics as diverse as Dorothy Parker and P.G. Wodehouse. An entertaining collection from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010ee7f8a5a5eefe968f5379b99d4076cd236751","amp;dn":"1000+Years+of+Laughter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010ee7f8a5a5eefe968f5379b99d4076cd236751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,14,231,248,165,165,238,254,150,143,83,121,185,157,64,118,205,35,103,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
