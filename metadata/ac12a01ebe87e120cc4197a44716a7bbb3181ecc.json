It is a collection of compelling photography and stories that capture the rage, love, optimism, darkness, and determination that shape his work. Combining the raw authenticity that defined his New York Times bestseller The Heroin Diaries with a photographic journey, This Is Gonna Hurt chronicles Sixs experiences from his early years filled with toxic waste, to his success with Motley Crue, to his near death from an OD and his eventual rebirth through music, photography, and love.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac12a01ebe87e120cc4197a44716a7bbb3181ecc","amp;dn":"This+Is+Gonna+Hurt+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac12a01ebe87e120cc4197a44716a7bbb3181ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,18,160,30,190,135,225,32,204,65,151,164,71,22,167,187,179,24,30,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
