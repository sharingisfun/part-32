The Other Half was originally on MySpace and Downtime was originally on USAToday.   Here, they're converted into .PNGs (just eight each).\n\nI think that they're pretty good, and the art in The Other Half is great.\n\nHope you enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7127a95d133ce773e40b84390cb0797f93f64ec","amp;dn":"Serenity+-+2+Web+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7127a95d133ce773e40b84390cb0797f93f64ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,18,122,149,209,51,206,119,62,64,184,67,144,203,7,151,249,63,100,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
