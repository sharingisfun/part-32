Today, it all gets too much. Today, he gets assigned something that finally breaks through his defenses, a child killing that hits horribly close to home. Until now, he's been a good cop, a cop who goes by procedure because it's the best way to ensure that scum go to prison. Today, he makes the parents of the victim a chilling promise. He will find the killer using any means necessary. And the killer will not get away with it. Whatever happens. How much of a monster do you have to become to hunt monsters\n\nBased on the response more warren ellis comics will be added :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0389cf221307b228b4c274050083ea3b460a1caa","amp;dn":"Warren+Ellis+Scars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0389cf221307b228b4c274050083ea3b460a1caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,137,207,34,19,7,178,40,180,194,116,5,0,131,234,59,70,10,28,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
