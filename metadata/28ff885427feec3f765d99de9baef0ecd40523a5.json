It uses 128 bit AES encryption for maximum security and does not store the password on the removable device . Once encrypted, the removable drive will produce an error message and cannot be opened if it is used on any other computer (unless it has StorageCrypt installed). The user will not know that the drive is protected, as it appears to be simply damaged. This approach has the advantage of being more secure, however it limits the portability of the data somewhat. The software can be used on an unlimited number of drives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ff885427feec3f765d99de9baef0ecd40523a5","amp;dn":"StorageCrypt+v2.0.1+with+Keymaker-BLiZZARD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ff885427feec3f765d99de9baef0ecd40523a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,255,136,84,39,254,236,63,118,93,153,222,155,174,240,236,212,5,35,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
