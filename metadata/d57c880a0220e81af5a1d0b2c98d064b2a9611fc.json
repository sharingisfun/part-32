The Toffees are unbeaten in their last four home encounters against Chelsea, winning the last three. Chelsea's last victory at Goodison came courtesy of a Michael Essien match-winning goal during the 2007/08 campaign.\n\nQueens Park Rangers host Liverpool at Loftus Road in the other game, with the 2011 season's 3-2 triumph for the Rs still fresh in the memory. The visitors led 2-0 with only 13 minutes of the game to go, only for Shaun Derry, Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie to turn the game on its head and kick-start what ultimately proved to be QPR's successful Premier League survival campaign.\n\nThere is also another chance to see all of the goals from Saturday's games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57c880a0220e81af5a1d0b2c98d064b2a9611fc","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+Two+30.12.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57c880a0220e81af5a1d0b2c98d064b2a9611fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,124,136,10,2,32,232,26,245,161,208,178,201,141,6,75,42,150,17,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
