Is it the delicious, time-honoured dishes cooked to perfection? Or the fresh, local ingredients and regional recipes? Or is it that most of these recipes started life in the home?

A committed champion of French food and cookery, and someone who is passionate about making home cooking approachable, Daniel gives us irresistible recipes for starters, mains, side dishes and desserts - all based on the classic principles that characterise brasserie cooking: regional recipes, local ingredients and homely, comforting flavours.
