Otherwise there is no need to reboot â€“ not even during installation.\r\n\r\nDrive Snapshot saves only the use disk space, compresses the data and is extremly fast a P4/2GHz will save approx. 1GByte/Minute on a local disk drive.\r\n\r\nOperating System:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\n1.
