On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67c4a6e37d4c86dacb831e729e6bb62490cdb7a6","amp;dn":"Neurocomics+Neurologic+%28Restored%29+%28Timothy+Leary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67c4a6e37d4c86dacb831e729e6bb62490cdb7a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,196,166,227,125,76,134,218,203,131,30,114,158,107,182,36,144,205,183,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
