One Fresh Batch of Lemonade \nCommunity Score\n8.4 Great \nreview\nFirst aired: 10/24/1984\n\nOne day, while showing off for some friends by riding his motorcycle in a wreckless manner, a car comes around a \nblind corner from the opposite direction and is not able to swerve out of the way in time to avoid hitting Deke. The \nnext time we see the young man, he is in the hospital where both of his legs have had to be amputated below the \nknee. Feeling bitter and resentful toward everyone, Deke drives away everyone who tries to visit with him. He \nseems intent on simply sulking and bemoaning his fate until the day he dies. Fortunately, this is where Jonathan \nsteps in to help. He has taken the job of physical therapist at the hospital, but it&amp;#039;s easy to see that it&amp;#039;s really Deke&amp;#039;s\n mental and emotional state that he&amp;#039;s there to work on. With the willing help of a quadriplegic patient named Scotty, \na shy fellow student named Eleanor, and a young gymnast who is the boy who crippled Deke, Jonathan sets out to \nrestore Deke&amp;#039;s faith in himself.\n\nWriter: Dan Gordon\nDirector: Michael Landon\nGuest star: Conrad Bachmann (Robert Halberstrom), Valerie Stanton (Mom), Nico DeSilva (Matinez), Michael Yama\n (Matire d&amp;#039;), Don Maxwell (Policeman), Thu Thuy (Waitress), David Wakefield (Guy #1), Russell Anderson (Mac), \nLeslie Ryan (Linda), John Touchstone (Arnold), Mary Betten (Mom), John Furlong (Charles), Ken Olandt \n(Deke Larson, Jr.), James Troesch (Scotty), Bart Conner (Richie Halbertstrom), Jim Haynie (Deke Larson, Sr.), \nShelby Leverington (Susan Larson), Bobbie Block (Eleanor), Virginia Capers (Miss Hendrickson) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3859dcaf996f4a9862e5773be8b21f12e7fcc1df","amp;dn":"Highway+to+Heaven+-+S01E06+-07++-+One+Fresh+Batch+of+Lemonaid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3859dcaf996f4a9862e5773be8b21f12e7fcc1df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,89,220,175,153,111,74,152,98,229,119,59,232,178,31,18,231,252,193,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
