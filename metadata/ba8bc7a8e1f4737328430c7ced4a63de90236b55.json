This recording is a \n\nrebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThere is a song by a Canadian quartet whose lead singer faked a speech impediment because he couldn't hold a \n\nmusical note very long and still sound good.\n\nNeil Sedaka is on the chart for the first time in eight years.\n\nThe Pointer Sisters are at number 26 with their son, &quot;Fairytale&quot; which went on to win them Best Country Vocal \n\nPerformance by a Duo or Group for the year 1974.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown by the man who has had more double-sided hits than anyone else before or since. \n\nBy this date he had 51 double-sided hits.\n\nA listener noticed that there have been 5 Canadian artists who have hit number one so far in 1974 and wants to \n\nknow if that made 1974 a record year for Canadians hitting number one on the American charts. Casey gives the \n\nanswer and all the details.\n\n40:    Willie And 4:37 The Hand Jive - Eric Clapton\n39:    Let's Straighten It Out - Latimore\n38:    Must Of Got Lost - J.
