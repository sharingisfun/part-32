Farmers markets and greenmarkets are popping up in cities and neighborhoods across the country. Shoppers are no longer restricted to the same 30 items in the produce section of the Kroger or Safeway. This cookbook invites you try Escarole Caesar Salad, a Dandelion Greens-Italian Sausage-Fontina Cheese Pizza, and Kohlrabi Salad with Pea Shoots. Farmers markets also introduce cooks to artisan cheesemakers, and the recipe for End of Summer Quiche plays up the tangy character of locally made goat cheese. Ivy Manning, cooking teacher, chef, and writerÃ¢â‚¬â€has gathered many of the recipes in her book from leading restaurants in Portland and Seattle that are notable practitioners of fresh local ingredients. Organized by seasons. each section also has an illustrated produce primer that introduces and explains the culinary qualities of spring greens, heirloom tomatoes (summer); pears and (fall), and winter squash.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63b13a94454de22a02ba9c08dfb7001eee11db02","amp;dn":"The+Farm+to+Table+Cookbook+-+The+Art+of+Eating+Locally+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63b13a94454de22a02ba9c08dfb7001eee11db02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,177,58,148,69,77,226,42,2,186,156,8,223,183,0,30,238,17,219,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
