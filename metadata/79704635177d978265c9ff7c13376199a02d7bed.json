Sayers's peerless literary creation proud. Ian Carmichael stars in his signature role as the stylish, cultured, and erudite Wimsey, whose investigation into the death of General Fentiman is as irresistible as &quot;poking sticks into a peaceful and mysterious-looking pond to see what was on the bottom.&quot; As the very British title suggests, this is not a crime thriller to set the pulse racing (the discovery of Fentiman's body is referred to as &quot;something rather unpleasant&quot;). But as the mystery unfolds over the course of 180 minutes, it is as captivating as a good late-night read.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79704635177d978265c9ff7c13376199a02d7bed","amp;dn":"Lord+Peter+Wimsey+-+The+Bellona+Club","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79704635177d978265c9ff7c13376199a02d7bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,112,70,53,23,125,151,130,101,201,255,124,19,55,97,153,160,45,123,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
