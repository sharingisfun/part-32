The fundamental theories, equations and computer programs in this book provide a ready way to analyze and solve a wide range of process design problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8aa38bf22c857fe278f430f6fee598f7ff6739","amp;dn":"Fortran+Programs+for+Chemical+Process+Design%2C+Analysis%2C+and+Simu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8aa38bf22c857fe278f430f6fee598f7ff6739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,138,163,139,242,44,133,127,226,120,244,48,246,254,229,152,247,255,103,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
