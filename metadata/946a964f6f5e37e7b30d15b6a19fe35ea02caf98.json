The results were assembled into this short film. What strikes one today, whether it is a sign of communist Poland at this time, or merely of Kieslowksi&amp;#039;s own fascination with moral questions, is how sombre and serious most of the answers are: no-one says they want to sleep with a film star or make a quick million. It&amp;#039;s also noticeable how similar the answers are, despite the great age difference of the participants. The best answer is fittingly the last one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:946a964f6f5e37e7b30d15b6a19fe35ea02caf98","amp;dn":"Krzysztof+Kieslowski+-+Gadajace+glowy+%2F+talking+heads+%281980%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"946a964f6f5e37e7b30d15b6a19fe35ea02caf98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,106,150,79,111,94,55,231,179,13,21,182,161,159,227,94,160,44,175,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
