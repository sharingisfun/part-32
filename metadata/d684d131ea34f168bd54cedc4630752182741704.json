Those novels were\nwritten prior to the fictionalized events of the 21st Century depicted in them, and\nthus should be treated as novels about alternate realities. The third installment in\nthis collection, CHILDREN OF TIME, will be published around early 2013. The\nyear in the dates shown in the headings are followed by the letters Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢,\ndenoting in which timeline the action is happening. Timeline Ã¢â‚¬ËœAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the original\nhistorical line, while Timeline Ã¢â‚¬ËœBÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a parallel alternate history created accidentally\nby Nancy Laplante when she was transported against her will from 2012 to the\nyear 1940 and changed history by her actions. Timeline Ã¢â‚¬ËœCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will be a second\nparallel alternate history but is yet to be created.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d684d131ea34f168bd54cedc4630752182741704","amp;dn":"Adventures+through+time+BY+%7BMichel+Poulin%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d684d131ea34f168bd54cedc4630752182741704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,132,209,49,234,52,241,104,189,84,206,220,70,48,117,33,130,116,23,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
