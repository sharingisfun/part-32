The nine-CD collection plays chronologically, beginning with the folk-rock pace and Everly Brothers harmonies of the 1972 self-titled debut (&quot;Take It Easy,&quot; &quot;Witchy Woman,&quot; &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;) and the 1973 Western concept album, Desperado (&quot;Tequila Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Desperado&quot;). Don Henley and Glenn Frey added guitarist Don Felder as the band steered in a rock direction for 1974Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s On the Border (&quot;Already Gone,&quot; &quot;James Dean&quot;) and toward a polished, FM-ready sound for 1975Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s One Of These Nights (&quot;Take it to the Limit,&quot; &quot;LyinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Eyes&quot;) before guitarist Joe Walsh joined as the Eagles reached their mainstream apex in 1976 with Hotel California (&quot;New Kid In Town,&quot; &quot;Life in the Fast Lane,&quot; &quot;Hotel California&quot;). While The Long Run in 1979 didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t measure up to its predecessor, it did fire off three successful singles--&quot;Heartache Tonight,&quot; &quot;The Long Run&quot; and &quot;I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Tell You Why&quot;--and led to the farewell tour that resulted in 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Eagles Live, 15 concert cuts (followed by a pair of holiday recordings) that close out the box set and the pre-reunion career of one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most revered bands.\n\nThis limited-edition box contains the entire pre-reunion Eagles catalog on nine CDs. \n\n\nEagles (1972)\nDesperado (1973)\nOn the Border (1974)\nOne of These Nights (1975)\nHotel California (1976)\nThe Long Run (1980)\nEagles Live (1980)\n\nBonus CD Single: Please Come Home for Christmas b/w Funky New Year (1978)\n\n\nAll of the album artwork is included along with audiochecker logs for authencity.
