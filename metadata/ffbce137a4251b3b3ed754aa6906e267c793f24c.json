Truckenmiller agreed, bringing in college friend Matt Kirby (guitar, vocals) to complete the group. Quietdrive then spent the next year and a half touring around the Midwest, gaining attention both from their live show and their MySpace site. Shortly after signing to Epic in late 2004, Quietdrive changed their name to &quot;Sneaker 2 Bomb,&quot; but recanted the decision before their debut album, When All That's Left Is You, was released in 2006.\nDeliverance followed in 2008 and they released a self-titled album in 2010.\n\nReleased: 2006, 2008, 2010\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Pop, Alternative\nQuality: VBR \nCodec: MP3\n\n Albums:\n\n Rise from the Ashes EP - 2006\n\n When All Thats Left is You - 2006\n\n Deliverance - 2008\n \n Quietdrive - 2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffbce137a4251b3b3ed754aa6906e267c793f24c","amp;dn":"Quietdrive+-+Discography+%282006-2010%29+%5Bmp3%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffbce137a4251b3b3ed754aa6906e267c793f24c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,188,225,55,164,37,27,59,62,215,84,170,105,6,226,103,199,147,242,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
