In 1960 she switched her focus to organ, working with Sonny Stitt. In 1963 she recorded the gem 'Soul Sisters' with jazz guitar legend Grant Green. Although she has not recorded that extensively in her career, she is a powerful player and has not lost anything through the decades.\n\nList of included albums:\n1963 Gloria Coleman - Soul Sisters\n1971 Gloria Coleman - Sings &amp; Swings Organ\n1994 Nat Simpkins - Cookin' With Some Barbeque \n2008 Gloria Coleman - Sweet Missy\n\n----------\n\nMP3 format.
