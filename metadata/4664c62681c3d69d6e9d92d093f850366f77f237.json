The flashing tools of the trade are a knife, a fork, and two metal spatulas. In spectacular displays of dexterity, chefs cut, stir, season, and divide each diner's portion onto plates on the iron griddle or &quot;teppan&quot;. As the food is prepared on the same surface that keeps it warm, meals are served as soon as they are ready.\n\nThis art form is both a show and a dish: the chef is often required to also perform for diners, such as juggling cutlery, flipping a shrimp into his shirt pocket, tossing an egg up in the air and splitting it with his knife, and flipping flattened shrimp pieces into the diners' mouths. Though perceived as Japanese, Teppanyaki is a most un-Japanese dish. It was first created in 1945 to cater to an American crowd bred on steaks on grills back home. Sushi and Okonomiyaki chefs were brought in to entertain the clientele with their fine cutting and quick cooking skills, preparing dishes to cater to a foreign taste bud.\n\n\n\n\nRebroadcast Air Date: 28-Sep-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4664c62681c3d69d6e9d92d093f850366f77f237","amp;dn":"Kung.Fu.Kitchen.S01E06.PDTV.x264-SammY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4664c62681c3d69d6e9d92d093f850366f77f237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,100,198,38,129,195,214,157,110,157,146,208,147,248,80,54,111,119,242,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
