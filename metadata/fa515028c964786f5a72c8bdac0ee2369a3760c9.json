Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The word intellivision is a portmanteau of &quot;intelligent television&quot;. Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.\n\nIn 2009, video game website IGN named the Intellivision the No. 14 greatest video game console of all time.&quot;\n\n\n---\n\n\nEmuXtras is a project to gather as much Xtras media for a gaming platform, and make it as complete as possible. Currently, this is all geared towards the Xbox and the Madmab Edition Emulator ports, but can also be used on other platforms. \n\nAll games are tested on the Xbox and each gaming system has a compatibility spreadsheet. \nGames are pre-configured so that the user can simply select a game without the need to configure it themselves. \n\nEmuXtras is the successor to the Ressurection Xtras. \n\t\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa515028c964786f5a72c8bdac0ee2369a3760c9","amp;dn":"Intellivision+EmuXtras+1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa515028c964786f5a72c8bdac0ee2369a3760c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,81,80,40,201,100,120,111,90,114,200,189,172,14,226,54,154,55,96,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
