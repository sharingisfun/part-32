When a mission requires the ship's crew to be placed in suspended animation for decades, Galaxina finds herself alone for many years, developing emotions and falling in love with the ship's pilot, Thor (Stephen Macht), as he and the other crew sleep the years away.\n\nBesides its homages/parodying of science fiction maintstays, the film also pokes fun at western movies.\n\n******************************************************************************\nOriginal Title: Galaxina\nReleased: 1980\nEng.
