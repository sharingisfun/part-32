Tom Freund recorded the song for his 2008 album Collapsible Plans, and this version appeared on the TV series One Tree Hill. Filipino singers Jed Madela and Sam Milby have also covered this song.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n----------\n\nNot to be confused with the '50s vocal group featuring Andy Williams, these Williams Brothers are the guitarists Andrew and David. Before recording on their own, they played in T-Bone Burnett's band and also backed up Brian Setzer. This was their biggest hit, it's a moving song about missing someone who has passed away and the helplessness that comes from never being able to see that person again. It has since been covered by several other artists, including Smokie and Christine Collister.
