Programs that monitored things such as smoke stack emissions, food inspections, oil spills, water quality and climate change have been drastically cut or shut down.\nThe fifth estate requested interviews with two senior bureaucrats and four cabinet ministers with responsibility for resources, the environment and science. All of those requests were denied.\nOn Tuesday, the fifth estate received a statement from the office of Greg Rickford, Minister of State for Science and Technology, and the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario.\n&quot;Our government has made record investments in science,&quot; it stated. &quot;We are working to strengthen partnerships to get more ideas from the lab to the marketplace and increase our wealth of knowledge. Research is vibrant and flourishing right across the country.&quot;\nBut members of the scientific community disagree. CBC's the fifth estate spoke to scientists across the country who are concerned that Canadians will suffer if their elected leaders have to make policy decisions without the benefit of independent, fact-based science.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4153/2o4l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4153/2o4l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/6912/58r1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/6912/58r1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9740/6myb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9740/6myb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/9600/71nn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/9600/71nn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9765/hi5r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9765/hi5r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/8288/jq6a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/8288/jq6a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 915 MB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Science%20Under%20Attack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Science%20Under%20Attack&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Story%20of%20Science&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Story%20of%20Science&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Silence_of_the_Labs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Silence_of_the_Labs&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718135190814fce4940dab928567d6428438e3ba","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Fifth+Estate+Silence+of+the+Labs+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718135190814fce4940dab928567d6428438e3ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,129,53,25,8,20,252,228,148,13,171,146,133,103,214,66,132,56,227,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
