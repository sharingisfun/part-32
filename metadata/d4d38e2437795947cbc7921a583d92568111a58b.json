Wake a Little Wiser\n\nThe Albion Band are an English folk/rock band, originally conceived, brought together and led by musician Ashley Hutchings. Generally considered one of the most important groupings in the genre, it has contained or been associated with a large proportion of major English folk performers in its long and fluid history. In 2011 for the first time in the bands history, Ashley stepped aside to let son, Blair Dunlop, lead a new generation of folk artists from a range of backgrounds in shaping a new Albion Band that went back to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots to make English rock music rooted in tradition.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In our opinion this album has the potential to become the seminal album release of 2012Ã¢â‚¬Â¦captures the very essence of what the Albion band is and what it stands for. It cleverly works in the best of what has gone before and boldly demonstrates why Folk-Rock is here to stay!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Folking.com\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4d38e2437795947cbc7921a583d92568111a58b","amp;dn":"The+Albion+Band+-+The+Vice+Of+The+People+%5B2012%5D+%5BAlbum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4d38e2437795947cbc7921a583d92568111a58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,211,142,36,55,121,89,71,203,199,146,26,88,61,146,86,129,17,165,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
