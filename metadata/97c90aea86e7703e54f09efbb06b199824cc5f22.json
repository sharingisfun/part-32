I do not like it too much. So I selected only the tracks in which I could recognize the Music while its sounds were gentle to my ears. Then I know, these songs will not scare too many clients away. Make them a bit nervous maybe. In all a small first step towards the Dubstep.\n \nAnd in strange way, after the playlist was ordered, my music message was completed. Music tells a lot and 305 playlists are saying enough. I Finished the music-document for my grand daughter. Cover Old and New. All major genres in eleven main languages.\n \nIts all about hitting a vibe. Well I tried. Music tells a story, through artists open and honest enough to let the music flow. You only have to (really) listen. I tried to return what I learned. \n\nIncluding honoring the very real people who are performing. Sometimes I could be them. So their massage became clear. I hope I seceded in translating that in my compilations.\n \nHowever, four years and 300.000 tracks is enough. Well I hope it is.....
