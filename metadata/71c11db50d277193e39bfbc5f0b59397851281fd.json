Current and only members consist of Craig Carson (Bass/Vocals/Synth), Peter Hunter (Guitar) and Mark Smyth (Drums). Formed by Craig Carson in July 2012, they came together looking to start something new and after a few months they (some how unintentionally) released 3 self recorded tracks which then became their demo &quot;DFWG&quot;. With growing interest the band started to gig and gain momentum. Since the demo was not the ideal sound they wanted, they set their goals on recording a full length album in late March 2013 with the talÂ­ented aid of Niall Doran at Start Together Studios, Belfast. Once this was secure the band enlisted the renowned James Plotkin to master the record, which they titled &quot;Holy Giants&quot;.\r\n\r\n&quot;The biggest draw on Holy Giants is how bizarrely atmospheric the release is. This isnâ€™t a half-arsed drudge through riffs that last too long; Holy Giants is a wonderfully textured and ethereal release that creates an extremely tense and foreboding atmosphere. Nomadic Rituals do this with a rather subtle blend of extremely down-tuned, grunty guitar work and then pepper it with death growls, black metal-esque screams and an understated use of electronics like on the quite frankly amazing â€˜The Ritualâ€™.&quot;\r\n- UK Scumscene Review\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;On the go since June 2012, Nomadic Rituals have built up a fearsome reputation for slow and dirty riffs as well as punishing live experiences that boarder on sonic terrorism.&quot; - Chris Owens, Chordblossom\r\n\r\nMEMBERS:\r\nCraig Carson - Bass, Vocals, Synth\r\nPeter Hunter - Guitar\r\nMark Smyth - Drums\r\n\r\nDISCOGRAPHY:\r\nDFWG (demo - 2012)\r\nHoly Giants (album - 2013)\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n1.
