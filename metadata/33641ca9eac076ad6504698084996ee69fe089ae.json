Also, if you like this show, please support the artist by buying their music.\n\n\n\nDecent recording, recorded from the second to last row in the auditorium. Apologies in advance for the guys next to me, one of them sings along to a few of the songs, not completely audible unless you are listening for it. The same guys felt the need to point out which album (incorrectly on quite a few) most of the songs were from after they were played. I tried minimizing the annoyances, but in some cases it would mean sacrificing the sound of the music, so I left those alone.\n\n\nButch Walker\n\n1. Atlanta\n2.
