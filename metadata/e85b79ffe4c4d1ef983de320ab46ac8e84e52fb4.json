He is a living legend whose lyrics are sung by fieldworkers and schoolchildren. He has assimilated some of the world's oldest literary traditions at the same time that he has struggled to open new possibilities for poetry. This collection spans Darwish's entire career, nearly four decades, revealing an impressive range of expression and form. A splendid team of translators has collaborated with the poet on these new translations, which capture Darwish's distinctive voice and spirit.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nWhen Darwish's selected The Adam of Two Edens was published by Syracuse in late 2000, the second Palestinian intifada was not yet bound up in &quot;the war on terror,&quot; and the book did not get much play, perhaps partially due to its disparate translations (and an uninviting cover). That should not be the case with this second selection of work by the poet often spoken of as the national poet of Palestine. Darwish, who lived more than 25 years in exile from his native Haifa, is currently living in Ramallah, and these selections, covering five books and 20 or so years, are uncompromising and powerful. Akash is the editor of Jusoor: The Arab American Journal of Cultural Exchange and co-editor of Post Gibran: An Anthology of New Arab American Writing (2000), but the key here is ForcheÃ¢â‚¬Å¡ (The Angel of History, etc.), who brings out the thorny immediacy and consistency in Darwish's complex linguistic negotiations of deeply contested places - places on the earth and in the mind. It is difficult to summarize those spaces here, but suffice to say that Darwish, as rendered in this English-only edition, demands, and sustains, serious reading and discussion, as in the magisterial long poem &quot;Mural&quot; from 2000: &quot;I will dream, not to correct any meaning beyond me,/ but to heal the inner desolation of its terrible drought.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e85b79ffe4c4d1ef983de320ab46ac8e84e52fb4","amp;dn":"Mahmoud+Darwish+-+Unfortunately%2C+It+Was+Paradise+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e85b79ffe4c4d1ef983de320ab46ac8e84e52fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,91,121,255,228,196,209,239,152,61,227,32,171,70,172,142,132,229,47,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
