When I started torrenting these bundles back in 2011, I had set a personal goal for myself to share 1,000 releases by the end of that 2011 year.  But because of my late start, I fell short of reaching that goal.  So I simply carried the goal over for 2012.\n\nWith today's 31 new titles in this 49th bundle, we're now up to 1,299 Christian releases this year.  Easily surpassing my hopes for 1,000.  Yet I still have plenty more to share, and my continued prayer is always the same ... Please share this music with those in need of the message.  Family members, friends colleagues, etc.  Please seed for a little longer than you might otherwise would.  Please support the artist in his/her ministry by purchasing those titles that find a warm place in your heart.  And in all, be thankful in Him.\n\nThis 49th bundle includes the following 31 titles today...\n\n * Allison Park Worship - 2012 - Undying Love - Single\n * Birdsongs, The - 2012 - Hold On - Single\n * Blue Maggie - 2012 - Thy Will\n * Brad And Rebekah - 2012 - My Home Is In You - Single\n * Brian Free And Assurance - 2012 - Nothing But Love\n * Brinson - 2012 - No Other Heroes\n * Ceezy - 2012 - Resurrection\n * Celtic Woman - 2012 - Home For Christmas\n * Currents - 2012 - Spirit And Truth\n * Darren Scruggs - 2012 - Castaway\n * Disciple - 2012 - O God Save Us All\n * Disciple - 2012 - RIP - Single\n * Gold City - 2012 - Live In Concert\n * Gold City - 2012 - Live In Gainesville GA\n * Hoppers - 2012 - Count Me In\n * Jac Rip - 2012 - Under God's Authority EP\n * Jackiem Joyner - 2012 - Church Boy\n * Jesus Culture - 2012 - Holy Spirit - Single\n * Julie Elias - 2012 - Breathing Room - Single\n * Kevin Deal - 2012 - There Goes The Neighborhood\n * Lifehouse - 2012 - Between The Raindrops - Single\n * Little Roy And Lizzy Show, The - 2012 - Lord In The Morning\n * Mannywellz - 2012 - Starting 5\n * Nick Gill - 2012 - By The Way - Single\n * OC Supertones, The - 2012 - For The Glory\n * Old Man Luedecke - 2012 - Tender Is The Night\n * S.O. - 2012 - It Continues\n * Skull Church - 2012 - When Darkness Shakes\n * Thi'sl - 2012 - Snap Off - Single\n * Various - 2012 - Gospel's Best - Christmas\n * Various - 2012 - The Light Of The Soul\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - November 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15521f30dd750e10c41c6b9dd48df837622f4732","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+49+of+49%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15521f30dd750e10c41c6b9dd48df837622f4732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,82,31,48,221,117,14,16,196,28,107,157,212,141,248,55,98,47,71,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
