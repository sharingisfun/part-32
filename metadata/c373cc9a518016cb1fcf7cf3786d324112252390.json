Ltd.\n\nReleased on 28.6.57 at Rupabani, Aruna, Bharati \n\nMovie: Sankirtana Movement or Hare Krishna Movement, Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu lived approximately 18 years in Nilachal, Jagannath Puri, between the years 1510 and 1534 during the reign of Gajapati Prataparudra Maharaj, the King of Orissa. This film, made in Bengal, India, in 1959, though historically not fully accurate, is an effective dramatic and devotional presentation of the LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s activities.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLord Chaitanya was born on February 27, 1486, at a time when India was suffering from rampant hedonism, spiritual stagnation, strict caste stratification, the prominence of logic over mystic experience, and domination by Islamic rulers. Socially, morally, spiritually, politically, and intellectually there was need for change.\n\nIn Kali-yuga, the current age, the dharma is nama-sankirtana, the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. To distribute the yuga-dharma, the Lord descends in each yuga. In Kali-yuga, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu appeared to spread nama-sankirtana. Apart from the function of spreading the yuga- dharma, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came to expose the world to the highest aspects of spiritual love (prema), which manifest in relation (rasa) to Krishna in His original form in Vrindavana.\n\nThe highest expression of rasa is the conjugal rasa in parakiya (outside of marriage). The ideal person in this relationship is Radha. While other Vaishnava lineages worship Krishna, the unique contribution of Lord Chaitanya is His detailed exposition of the higher modes of rasa, which He personified by acting as a devotee of the Lord, experiencing pure love in the mood of Radha. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave a complete revelation of GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s love for the souls, and the soulsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ love for God. This is unparalleled in any movement or any religion.\n\nHow are we to attain this high stage of love? Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wanted that greatest treasure to be given out to as many people as possible. Therefore He has also taught a processÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the simplest and most direct process: nama- sankirtana. Chanting the names of Krishna does not require any qualification except faith. Birth, caste, race, country, profes-sion, and education are not considerations in chanting GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s names. The only requirement is a sincere acceptance of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own position as the servant, offering service out of selfless love to the most attractive, deserving object: Krishna. Adherence to chanting in a pure manner leads directly to the highest goal, pure love of Krishna.\n\nChaitanya MahaprabhuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movement therefore presents a complete picture of intimate loving relationships with God, a philosophy consistent with direct statements of scripture to support those relationships, and a simple, practical process to realize them.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBhanu Swami (abridged) http://www.krishna.com/lord-chaitanya-life-and-teachings\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c373cc9a518016cb1fcf7cf3786d324112252390","amp;dn":"Nilachale+Neelachaley+Mahaprabhu+1957+%28plz+donate+itv+bala.ru%29+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c373cc9a518016cb1fcf7cf3786d324112252390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,115,204,154,81,128,22,203,31,207,124,243,120,109,50,65,18,37,35,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
