Brazenly operating close to shore, German U-boats were a genuine threat to American Merchant Marine vessels, causing the deaths of hundreds of sailors. To counteract this threat, The &quot;Hooligan Navy&quot; was formed by the members of the Cruising Club of America, an organization of New England Yachtsmen. This ragtag group of sailors, undraftable reservists and adventurers were adopted by the U.S. Coast Guard and officially christened the Coastal Picket Patrol. Their sleek wooden yachts were repainted gray and outfitted with guns and listening equipment. For the rest of the war, they served as the eyes and ears of the Navy, seeking out and occasionally destroying U-boats and once again making the Atlantic Coast safe for shipping. Eventually, many members of the &quot;Hooligan Navy&quot; received commendations and medals for their wartime bravery. THE HOOLIGAN NAVY is a revealing look at one of the most colorful and least heralded stories of World War II.\r\n\r\nProduced by MPH Entertainment for A&amp;E Television Networks\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/14/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/The-Hooligan-Navy-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\r\nVideo Bitrate: 2338 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.324:1\r\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 48:00.406\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 894 MB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Hooligan_Navy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:658c6716d8f03b0862f37d5b8d57f70c99baebd4","amp;dn":"HC+Sea+Tales+The+Hooligan+Navy+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"658c6716d8f03b0862f37d5b8d57f70c99baebd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,140,103,22,216,240,59,8,98,243,125,91,141,87,247,12,153,186,235,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
