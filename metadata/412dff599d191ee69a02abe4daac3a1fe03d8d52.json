The show featured performers in a wide variety of musical genres but was particularly known as a showcase for jazz and electric music.\nIt was hosted by Jools Holland (only first season) and David Sanborn, and featured Marcus Miller as musical director.\nGuests included acts such as Sonny Rollins, Shinehead, Sister Carol, Sonic Youth, Joe Sample, Slim Gaillard, Pere Ubu, Pharoah Sanders, and many others. In addition, vintage clips of jazz legends like Thelonious Monk, Dave Brubeck, and Billie Holiday were also featured.\nThe show also featured a house band of Omar Hakim (drums), Marcus Miller (bass), Philippe Saisse (keys), David Sanborn (sax), Hiram Bullock (guitar), and Jools Holland (piano).\nThe show often allowed its guests ample time to explain the origins of their sound, meaning of songs, etc.\nIt also provided a national audience for lesser known acts (like Arto Lindsay's band The Ambitious Lovers).\nHal Willner was the music coordinator, responsible for the interesting musical mix-and-matching that took place on the show.\n\n..\n\npretty sure I saw the Judy video recently at a Marley &amp; Tosh bootlegger site.\n\nFREE TRADE, NEVER FOR SALE at RT of course, just like these two nice eighties videos were shared orig. by lemeteque at hungercity.org (HC).\n\nenjoy,\n\nchico, reggaetraders.net (RT), 2012/08/20\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://veryrare.org/_ld/0/73541579.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://veryrare.org/_ld/0/73541579.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://veryrare.org/_ld/0/13414894.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://veryrare.org/_ld/0/13414894.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412dff599d191ee69a02abe4daac3a1fe03d8d52","amp;dn":"Judy+Mowatt+%26amp%3B+Sister+Carol+-+Night+Music+%281988%29+%5BDVD5+NTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412dff599d191ee69a02abe4daac3a1fe03d8d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,45,255,89,157,25,30,230,154,2,171,228,218,172,58,31,224,61,141,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
