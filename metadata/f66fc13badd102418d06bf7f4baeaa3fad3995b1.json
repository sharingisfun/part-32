In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f66fc13badd102418d06bf7f4baeaa3fad3995b1","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Ndipeiwo+Zano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f66fc13badd102418d06bf7f4baeaa3fad3995b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,111,193,59,173,209,2,65,141,6,191,127,75,174,170,63,173,57,149,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
