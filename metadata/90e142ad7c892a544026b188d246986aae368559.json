Five years later, Sneaker Pimps founder Chris Corner aka I AM X embarks on a solo journey to showcase his exceptional production and songwriting talent. &amp;#039;Kiss + Swallow&amp;#039; is really all about songs: dark, futuristic ones expressed in an electronic environment. From Kiss and Swallow, an upbeat radio anthem, to the 80?s influenced Heatwave or the end of days White Suburb Impressionism, the album swings moods flawlessly and captures the listener. This is an electro-pop masterpiece, owing as much to the contemporary electronic productions of Berlin and Detroit as to the pop of Prince or Cabaret Voltaire. Chris Corner?s voice is the unifying thread, at times similar to the howlings of Cabaret Voltaire, always with the emotional clarity of Curtis Mayfield.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e142ad7c892a544026b188d246986aae368559","amp;dn":"IAMX+-+Kiss+and+swallow%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e142ad7c892a544026b188d246986aae368559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,225,66,173,124,137,42,84,64,38,177,136,210,70,152,106,174,54,133,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
