Native America, Tibet, Israel/Palestine, Algeria, Africa, Pakistan, and India are all represented here, with the artist's expressed goal to &quot;convey the diversity of the world through a common spirit.&quot;  The concept works well, with Khan and a stellar multicultural lineup of musicians tailoring each song to its singer.  Fela Ababsa lends her captivating voice to &quot;Night of Algerian,&quot; which segues seamlessly into &quot;Algerian Sunrise,&quot; a gorgeous instrumental passage featuring the strings of Bulgaria's Plovdiv Chamber Orchestra.  Morocco's Mamani Kei&quot;ta's passionate wail drives the fiery &quot;Night of the Gnawas&quot; to a dynamic crescendo, with wickedly syncopated rhythms and strings helping to sell the drama.  Only on the insistent &quot;Night of Navajos&quot; does Khan make a misstep, his synthesized sounds taking the listener out of the timeless mood the previous songs create.  Still, this is a bold, experimental record that shows it really is a small world after all. ~ Bret Love, AMG\n\nI have a lot of world music samplers and a consistant problem with them is that they are not consistant. But this album has 7 diffrent tracts from 7 diffrent cultures and every one of them is a gem. ~ Anthony T. Milazzo\n\nVery inspired album. A beautiful collection from the world. Every track is sung by a woman in her native tongue. Orchestral arrangements make the CD universal. I look for more from Mad Sheer Khan!! ~ BPMan\n\nHow sad that this wonderful album has been discontinued by the publisher. These seven tracks are each beautiful, profound and rich. Like so many other Algerian-born musicians, Mad Sheer Khan shows himself to be a true world musician. Worth hunting for! ~ Marius Cipolla\n\nPersonnel:\nMad Sheer Khan (Oud, Sitar, Rebab, Santur, Keyboards, Percussion and Programming) \nAhmed Dhemai (Percussion) \nSubramaniam (Violin) \nPlovdiv Chamber Orchestra (Strings) \nNasser (Percussion) \nJean-Pierre Arnaud (Oboe and English Horn) \nBruno Caillat (Zarb) \nFela Ababsa (Vocals) - 1 \nMamani Keita (Vocals) - 2 \nNourith (Vocals) - 3 \nMary Redhouse (Vocals) - 4 \nKunchock Lama (Vocals) - 5 \nSharmila Roy (Vocals) - 6 \nParvin Javdan (Vocals) - 7 \n\nMad Sheer Khan - 1001 Nights Tracks:\n01  Night of Algeria 5:34 \n02  Night of Gnawas 9:44 \n03  Night of Hebrews 8:34 \n04  Night of Navajos 8:55 \n05  Night of Tibet 7:43 \n06  Night of India 11:20 \n07  Night of Persia 11:13 \nAll compositions by Mad Sheer Khan \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff820042bea5f772eeeb591682c8b8150af43b54","amp;dn":"Mad+Sheer+Khan+-+1001+Nights+%281999%29+%5BNew+Age-World%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff820042bea5f772eeeb591682c8b8150af43b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,130,0,66,190,165,247,114,238,235,89,22,130,200,184,21,10,244,59,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
