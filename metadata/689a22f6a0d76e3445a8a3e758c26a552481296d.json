Frey, Shuichi Fukuda, Georg Rock, &quot;Improving Complex Systems Today&quot; \n Sp,,,er | 2011 | ISBN: 0857297988 | 496 pages | PDF | 12.4 MB \n\n As the main theme of Improving Complex Systems Today implies, this book is intended to provide readers with a new perspective on concurrent engineering from the standpoint of systems engineering. It can serve as a versatile tool to help readers to navigate the ever-changing state of this particular field.\n\n The primary focus of concurrent engineering was, at first, on bringing downstream information as far upstream as possible by introducing parallel processing in order to reduce time to market and to prevent errors at a later stage which would sometimes cause irrevocable damage. Up to now, numerous new concepts, methodologies and tools have been developed, but over concurrent engineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 20-year history the situation has changed extensively. Now, industry has to work in the global marketplace and to cope with diversifying requirements and increasing complexities. Such globalization and diversification necessitate collaboration across different fields and across national boundaries. Thus, the new concurrent engineering calls for a systems approach to gain global market competitiveness. Improving Complex Systems Today provides a new insight into concurrent engineering today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689a22f6a0d76e3445a8a3e758c26a552481296d","amp;dn":"Improving+Complex+Systems+Today","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689a22f6a0d76e3445a8a3e758c26a552481296d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,154,34,246,160,215,110,52,69,168,163,231,88,194,106,85,36,129,41,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
