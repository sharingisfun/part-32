Dijkstra et al. (Blackwell, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4051-5691-2\r\n\r\nTrans fatty acids (TFAs) have been used for many years to impart desirable physical characteristics to fats and fat blends used in food manufacturing. However, clinical trials and epidemiological studies conducted over the last thirty years have shown that TFAs can increase â€œbadâ€ cholesterol levels in the blood while reducing â€œgoodâ€ cholesterol. Accordingly, they are also linked with increased risks of coronary heart disease, thrombosis and strokes. For this reason, the food industry has been obliged to find alternatives to TFAs, thus enabling it to meet the presumed consumer demand for â€œlowâ€ or â€œnoâ€ trans fats products. The issue is becoming more and more pressing. For example, US labelling regulations now require that food manufacturers state the trans fat content of their products on the packaging.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book provides an overview of trans fatty acids in oils and fats used in food manufacture. Topics covered include: the chemistry and occurrence of TFAs; analytical methods for determining the fatty acid composition including TFAs of foods; processing techniques for reducing, minimising or even avoiding the formation of TFAs; TFA alternatives in food; health and nutrition concerns and legislative aspects. It is directed at chemists and technologists working in edible oils and fats processing and product development; food scientists and technologists; analytical chemists and nutritionists working in the food industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9caad592a07745a91f16028fdf261e89ac05bf61","amp;dn":"Trans+Fatty+Acids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9caad592a07745a91f16028fdf261e89ac05bf61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,170,213,146,160,119,69,169,31,22,2,143,223,38,30,137,172,5,191,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
