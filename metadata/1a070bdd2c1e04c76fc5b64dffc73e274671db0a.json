In 2000, the puppets were auctioned off at Sotheby's and in the course of the programme the team sets out to discover where they now reside and who is taking care of them in their old age. \n\nRevealing the extraordinary technical achievement of the series, Arena meets the caricaturists, puppet-mould makers, designers, puppeteers, impressionists, writers and directors who worked tirelessly to ensure the show landed its weekly jibes and punches at the politicians, royals and celebrities of the day. \n\nTracing its journey to our televisions screens through 12 years of huge audience figures and weekly controversy to its eventual demise, the film asks what Spitting Image got right, where it went wrong and whether its absence since 1996 has left a hole in the schedules that has yet to be filled by modern broadcasting\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03yg3yn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03yg3yn&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\n \nArena - Whatever Happened To Spitting Image (1x60 Minutes)\n\n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Whatever Happened To Spitting Image.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 0mn\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 629 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 0mn\nBitrate                     : 1 513 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.202\nStream size                 : 650 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 1h 0mn\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 104 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 44.6 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 583 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a070bdd2c1e04c76fc5b64dffc73e274671db0a","amp;dn":"Arena+-+Whatever+Happened+To+Spitting+Image+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a070bdd2c1e04c76fc5b64dffc73e274671db0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,7,11,221,44,30,4,199,111,197,182,77,255,199,62,39,70,113,219,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
