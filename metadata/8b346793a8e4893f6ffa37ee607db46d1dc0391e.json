They're the three aliens whose spaceship has crashed in a small town outside of Baltimore. Soon the town folk are turning up mutilated and dead - and even in polyester pants. Then a stranger arrives to save the day. But is he who he says he is? And what about all the polyester pants? See this film they way it was meant to be seen - on the big screen live with Cinematic Titanic.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCinematic Titanic is a project by Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) creator and original host, Joel Hodgson.[1] The project involves &quot;riffing&quot; B-movies, in a manner similar to that of MST3K.[2] Joining Hodgson are many of the original MST3K cast, as well as some cast members who joined later in the show's run.[3] These include Trace Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl.[4] It was first performed live on December 7, 2007 and first aired on December 22, 2007.\n\nOn February 16, 2013, it was announced that the touring portion of Cinematic Titanic was going on an indefinite hiatus. According to an email sent out to members of the site, due to &quot;5 people living in 5 different cities with different lives and projects, it has become increasingly difficult to coordinate our schedules and give Cinematic Titanic the attention it requires to keep growing as a creative enterprise and a business.&quot;[5] The final tour began on September 23, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b346793a8e4893f6ffa37ee607db46d1dc0391e","amp;dn":"Cinematic+Titanic+-+09+-+The+Alien+Factor+%7B1978%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b346793a8e4893f6ffa37ee607db46d1dc0391e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,52,103,147,168,228,137,63,111,250,55,238,96,125,180,109,29,192,57,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
