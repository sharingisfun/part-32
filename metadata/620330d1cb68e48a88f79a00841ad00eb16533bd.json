Ultraviolence is the upcoming third studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. It is scheduled to be released by Polydor and Interscope Records, on June 16, Bloomsday 2014.\n\n\n\n[Bloomsday is a commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce during which the events of his novel Ulysses (which is set on 16 June 1904) are relived. It is observed annually on 16 June in Dublin and elsewhere. Joyce chose the date as it was the date of his first outing with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle; they walked to the Dublin suburb of Ringsend. The name is derived from Leopold Bloom, the Ulyssean protagonist. \n\nThe day involves a range of cultural activities including Ulysses readings and dramatisations, pub crawls and other events, much of it hosted by the James Joyce Centre in North Great George's Street. Enthusiasts often dress in Edwardian costume to celebrate Bloomsday, and retrace Bloom's route around Dublin via landmarks such as Davy Byrne's pub. Hard-core devotees have even been known to hold marathon readings of the entire novel, some lasting up to 36 hours. \n\n- In 1956, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath were married by special licence of the Archbishop of Canterbury at St George the Martyr Church, Holborn, on 16 June, in honour of Bloomsday. \n\n- The post-punk band Minutemen have a song on their 1984 Double Nickels on the Dime album entitled &quot;16 June&quot;.\n\n- Richard Linklater alludes to Ulysses in two of his films. In 1991's Slacker, a character reads an excerpt from Ulysses after convincing his friends to dump a tent and a typewriter in a river as a response to a prior lover's infidelity. In 1995's Before Sunrise, events take place on 16 June.\n\n- Los Angeles: The Hammer Museum hosts an annual Bloomsday celebration including: live Irish music, a Guinness happy hour, a public reading of the &quot;Lestrygonians&quot; episode, and a dramatic reading of &quot;Sirens&quot;.]\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n&quot;Lolita in the 'hood'&quot;\n\n&quot;Few pop singers divide audiences like Lana Del Rey. Just what is it about the sweet-voiced, doe-eyed chanteuse that attracts such extreme opinions?&quot;\n\nKirstin Trantor, Sydney Morning Herald, May 10, 2014 -- &quot;...The criticism reached new levels of intensity after Del Rey's appearance on Saturday Night Live in January 2012, with clips of her clumsy performance circulating widely online. No other performer inspires a comparable level of animosity. Feminist website Jezebel asks, &quot;Why do you hate Lana Del Rey? I do not know why I hate Lana Del Rey.&quot; In a carnival of schadenfreude, the website Buzzfeed compiled &quot;Twenty-six Meanest Quotes from Reviews of Lana Del Rey&quot;. Sites on Tumblr such as I Hate Lana Del Rey subscribe openly to the idea that the singer's success is due to canny promotion of her sex appeal: &quot;Cash comes quick when looks can kill,&quot; explains the heading of another Del Rey &quot;troll&quot; blog.\n\n&quot;None of it ever seemed to make any sense,&quot; Del Rey says, reflecting on the intensity of her reception, halting between words. &quot;I'm not a provocateur. I love to write. The written word is one of the last forms of magic we have. I love rhyming and writing. For years my focus was on building a beautiful visual world and beautiful sonic world and yeah, having such a strong reaction was ... surprising? I don't know.&quot;\n\nShe went through a painful period of writer's block while touring after the release of Born to Die, &quot;trying to write things that I thought would be more accessible,&quot; and for a while she doubted whether she would release another record. &quot;It's this feeling that comes over you, like falling in love,&quot; she says of the inspiration to write. &quot;You have to get that sensation.&quot;\n\nThat feeling returned when she met Dan Auerbach, of rock group the Black Keys, who wound up producing her new album. Del Rey had been feeling for a while that there was something missing from her sound, &quot;a fuzzy guitar tone that I couldn't bring on my own&quot;. Upon meeting Dan, she thought, &quot;Maybe this is my guy!&quot;\n\nThe album has taken a while to put together - two and a half years - due to Del Rey's hands-on approach. &quot;I'm involved in the process, from the mixing to the mastering. Every single part of it has to be right...&quot;\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n&quot;14 Reasons 'West Coast' Is Lana Del Rey's Most Lana Del Rey-y Music Video Yet&quot;\n\n14 reasons w/ 14 gifs, c/o John Boone, May 7, 2014, eonline news\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nSample caps n bannas\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-19h07m59s214.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-19h07m59s214.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h42m00s3.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h42m00s3.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h42m36s167.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h42m36s167.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h42m58s138.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h42m58s138.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h44m01s249.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h44m01s249.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h44m50s226.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h44m50s226.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h44m33s51.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h44m33s51.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h45m52s86.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h45m52s86.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h46m14s56.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-2014-06-06-20h46m14s56.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/6c0b6474-898f-460c-92d9-00ada5bf4686.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/6c0b6474-898f-460c-92d9-00ada5bf4686.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/314e3b8e-73d5-4449-b5be-cca89c139b8a.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/314e3b8e-73d5-4449-b5be-cca89c139b8a.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620330d1cb68e48a88f79a00841ad00eb16533bd","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+West+Coast+%282014%29+%5BM6+Clips+HDTV+-+TS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620330d1cb68e48a88f79a00841ad00eb16533bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,3,48,209,203,104,228,138,136,247,154,0,132,26,208,14,177,101,51,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
