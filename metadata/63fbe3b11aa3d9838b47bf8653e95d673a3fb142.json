The film follows the recent expedition of the world's top nature photographers to the Great Bear Rainforest - in the heart of the proposed tanker route - to document the incredible wilderness and cultural values at stake from tankers that would carry Tar Sands crude through these waters en route to Asia and the United States. SPOIL recently claimed the environmental film prize at the Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SpoilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢: The Disaster Of The Northern Gateway Tar Sands Pipeline &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/green/2012/02/06/419568/spoil-the-disaster-of-the-northern-gateway-tar-sands-pipeline/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thinkprogress.org/green/2012/02/06/419568/spoil-the-disaster-of-the-northern-gateway-tar-sands-pipeline/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Brad Johnson on Feb 6, 2012 at 12:15 pm\n\n'Spoil,' a 45-minute documentary by the International League of Conservation Photographers, highlights the potential environmental and social disaster that could result from the construction of the Enbridge Northern Gateway tar sands pipeline, through the eyes of some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top nature photographers. That pipeline would go from AlbertaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tar sands, over the Canadian Rockies, and through a fragile rainforest ecosystem in British Columbia to feed the energy-hungry Asian markets. The entire documentary is free to watch online:\n\nAlthough Keystone XL advocates like to portray the flowing of tar sands crude to China as inevitable, the dangerous Northern Gateway pipeline is just as controversial.
