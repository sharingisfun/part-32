As had been the\ncase time and again, the Miles Davis quintet was reinvented during this period. A perfectionist\nwith a golden tone, the trumpeter demanded no less from his compatriots.\n\nArranged in chronological order from April 16, 1963 in Los Angeles to September 25, 1964 in\nBerlin, this superb collection traces the development that Davis wanted, ending with Wayne\nShorter on tenor saxophone, Herbie Hancock on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Tony\nWilliams on drums.\n\nThe eight previously unreleased tracks include Victor Feldman's &quot;Joshua,&quot; with cohesive\ninterplay from Davis, Feldman, Carter, George Coleman, and Frank Butler. Davis was in fine\nform, and the music ran perfectly straightahead. Two takes of &quot;Seven Steps to Heaven&quot; with\nthe same lineup, but one moving faster than the other, and one alternate take with a newer\nlineup and a false start, cement the piece as a standard part of the Davis repertoire. The\nopen horn arrangement makes the most sense, since Davis had a beautiful tone to share.\n\nA thirteen-minute version of &quot;Stella by Starlight&quot; in Berlin with Shorter, Hancock, Carter and\nWilliams makes a pleasant surprise. Davis plays it soulfully, building his featured opening\nbeyond expectations. Emotions run high. Walking bass and ride cymbal keep things even for\nShorter's entrance. But he, too, builds his solo section beyond the usual, emotionally. That\nmay explain why the piece remained unissued for all those years. In all, however, it's a\nwelcome surprise: one of the package's high points.\n\nMany of the sessions were recorded at live performances; locations include Juan-les-Pins in\nFrance, Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo, and Berlin.\n\nAt the Festival Mondial du Jazz Antibes in France, Davis led an informal session that found\nthe music just rolling out casually, with his band at a creative high point. As the applause\nappears during each track, we're tempted to join in. These are longer tracks: the kind that\nallow an artist and his band to explore in-depth. &quot;Walkin',&quot; with its upbeat tempo and bebop\narticulation, stretches out endlessly, with Davis, Williams, Coleman and Hancock finding\nplenty of room to solo. The unheralded tenor saxophonist, in particular, gives his audience\nsomething to remember for eternity.\n\nAt Philharmonic Hall in New York, we listen in on two sets with Coleman on tenor and Davis'\nquintet on fire. Again, the longer pieces allow much room for freedom by each artist. &quot;All\nBlues,&quot; with open horn, etches its familiar melody into our psyche and stands apart from the\nrest for its emotion-laden presentation. Similarly, &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; gives us a unique\nperformance on open horn that remains unmatched by any other.\n\nSam Rivers replaced Coleman at Kohseinenkin Hall in Tokyo. The full set, while containing\nno big surprises, once again allowed plenty of time for individual stretching. The songs are\nthe same, but the interpretations are changed somewhat. Rivers gives the quintet a mellower\nhue with more restraint. His fluid phrasing gave Davis a strong supporting partner who turned\nout, perhaps, too much like the leader. Rivers, too, could build his solo spots into something\nfurious and dynamic; however, the bulk of his work remained comparatively gentle. The most\nnoticeable difference came when Davis and Rivers played side by side in ensemble.\n\nWayne Shorter replaced Rivers at the Berlin Philharmonie in Germany. He gave the quintet a\nheartier sound. Like John Coltrane, Shorter's energy went through the horn and made\neveryone sit up and take notice. His full tone gave Davis what he wanted for his rebuilt\nensemble. Together, they produced a session that excelled: the same pieces with a different\nlineup.\n\nThroughout these 1963-64 sessions, Davis plays with his characteristic mood. Whether\nmuted or open, he pours heartfelt emotion through his horn. No one has ever done it better.\n\nPersonnel\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet), Ron Carter (bass), George Coleman (tenor saxophone on discs 1-5),\nVictor Feldman (piano on disc 1), Frank Butler (drums on disc 1), Herbie Hancock (piano on\ndiscs 2-7), Tony Williams (drums on discs 2-7), Sam Rivers (tenor saxophone on disc 6),\nWayne Shorter (tenor saxophone on disc 7)\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n   1.
