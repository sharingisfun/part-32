Using only those medications that have an official indication for a certain condition reduces substantially the chance of the patient gaining pain relief and may expose them to intolerable side effects. However evidence now exists on the use of other drugs, produced for non-pain conditions, and how they can substantially increase the chances of pain relief.\n\nCovering the most recent developments in this field, McCleane offers an alternative solution to pain treatment when conventional treatments fail. This pioneering book proposes evidence-based alternatives to current options in pain management, using well-grounded rationales for each given treatment.\n\nThis book is an ideal reference for the specialist and non-specialist prescriber alike and for practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines. It provides the evidence required and treatment algorithms for readers to use the drugs appropriately and to explore the field if they wish.\n\nPaperback: 200 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (July 8, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 140517823X\nISBN-13: 978-1405178235","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7610e56dbf750a5ec28817cae0b5c286c4cd9dfb","amp;dn":"Pain+Management%3AExpanding+the+Pharmacological+Options%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7610e56dbf750a5ec28817cae0b5c286c4cd9dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,16,229,109,191,117,10,94,194,136,23,202,224,181,194,134,196,205,157,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
