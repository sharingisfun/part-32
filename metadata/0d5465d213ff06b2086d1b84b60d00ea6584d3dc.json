The vengeful god of the underworld, Hades, demands that Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice or he will unleash the Kraken against Argos. A desperate King Cepheus asks demi-god Perseus to find a way to defeat the Kraken. Perseus accepts the challenge because Hades was responsible for his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. He discovers that the way to kill the Kraken lies with getting the head of the gorgon Medusa.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800320/\nRelease Date: 2 April 2010 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Fantasy\nStars: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 1080p.Bluray.x264-CBGB\nSize: 700MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5465d213ff06b2086d1b84b60d00ea6584d3dc","amp;dn":"Clash+of+the+Titans+%282010%29+BluRay+700MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5465d213ff06b2086d1b84b60d00ea6584d3dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,84,101,210,19,255,6,178,8,109,27,132,182,13,0,234,101,132,211,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
