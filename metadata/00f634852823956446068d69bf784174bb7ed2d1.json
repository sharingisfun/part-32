Hunters and Hunted.\nThe nature documentary explores mammals' ability to learn new survival tricks. In a TV first, a killer whale is shown sneaking into a pool where elephant seal pups learn to swim, saving itself the trouble of hunting in the open sea. Slow-motion cameras reveal how the star-nosed mole can smell prey underwater; young ibex run up an almost vertical cliff face to escape a fox; and young stoats fight mock battles, learning the skills that make them one of the world's most efficient predators.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 1.80GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f634852823956446068d69bf784174bb7ed2d1","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+07of10+Hunters+and+Hunted+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f634852823956446068d69bf784174bb7ed2d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,246,52,133,40,35,149,100,70,6,141,105,191,120,65,116,187,126,210,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
