And, even with the Stonesy grind of &quot;Sweet Rosalyn&quot; or hippie spirits of &quot;Love Is a Good Thing,&quot; it is an album that couldn't have been made any other time than the '90s. As strange as it may sound, Sheryl Crow is a postmodern masterpiece of sorts -- albeit a mainstream, post-alternative, postmodern masterpiece. It may not be as hip or innovative as, say, the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, but it is as self-referential, pop culture obsessed, and musically eclectic. Throughout the record, Crow spins out wild, nearly incomprehensible stream-of-consciousness lyrics, dropping celebrity names and products every chance she gets (&quot;drinking Falstaff beer/Mercedes Ruehl and a rented Leer&quot;). Often, these litanies don't necessarily add up to anything specific, but they're a perfect match for the mess of rock, blues, alt-rock, country, folk, and lite hip-hop loops that dominate the record. At her core, she remains a traditionalist -- the songcraft behind the infectious &quot;Change Would Do You Good,&quot; the bubbly &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road,&quot; and the weary &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; helped get the singles on the radio -- but the production and lyrics are often at odds with those instincts, creating for a fascinating and compelling (and occasionally humorous) listen and one of the most individual albums of its era.  ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n\nCD ripped with EAC.
