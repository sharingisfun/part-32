The series takes place in the 22nd Century, after the non-nuclear Third World War decimates the Earth. While states like Great Britain, France and China have difficulty maintaining order and power, international organisations like the &quot;Sacred Republique of Mumna&quot; and &quot;Poseidon&quot; have been established in the aftermath.\n\nThe main characters are Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires, former SWAT members of the LAPD. They are found in the desolated city and invited to join the prestigious ESWAT (Extra Special Weapons And Tactics) organisation in the utopian city of Olympus, the new world's most powerful state. Roughly one half of Olympus's population are bioroids (cyborgs).\n\nThe series follows Deunan and Briareos as they protect their new home from enemies, both foreign and domestic.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f8558ea2a1085b3e282a4c8850e64ccebd9340","amp;dn":"Appleseed+Books+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f8558ea2a1085b3e282a4c8850e64ccebd9340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,248,85,142,162,161,8,91,62,40,42,76,136,80,230,76,206,189,147,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
