Release: 2012.\n\n\nA Canadian legend. Her first contract took her to Nashville in 1955 when she was fifteen, and when Elvis Presley was being signed to RCA. She too was signed to RCA. Her ultra-rare 1950s and '60s recordings have never been reissued. Now the best of them have been carefully remastered for this definitive CD.\n\nMyrna Lorrie was from the remote Canadian city of Thunder Bay north. Mentored by greats like Hank Snow and Cowboy Copas who saw her talent, she was signed by the man who discovered Loretta Lynn, and made her first recordings for Abbott, where Jim Reeves and the Browns started, and like them she too departed for RCA. After RCA sessions in New York and Nashville produced some great music breakthrough, she returned to Canada. A television star in Canada for years, Myrna Lorrie helped new singers just as she'd been helped. Among them was Shania Twain. 'It would have turned out differently, if I'd stayed in the States,' Myrna Lorrie told Todd Everett, who wrote the notes for this compilation. 'But I was patriotic and stayed in Canada.'\n\nNow it's time for the rest of the world to discover what Canadians already know: Myrna Lorrie is a Juke Box Pearl. Amazing collection (6 unreleased) of top notch 1950s Hillbilly, Honky Tonk and some Pop-crossovers like the Tiki Bar cult classic &quot;On A Little Bamboo Bridge&quot;. Produced by Fabor Robison &amp; Chet Atkins.
