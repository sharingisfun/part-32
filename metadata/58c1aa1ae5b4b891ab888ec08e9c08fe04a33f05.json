Harris\nready by Gary Oldman\n\nA monologue radio play that aired in 2002 on BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Radio 4.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Warren is compulsive, lonely and passionate. He lives alone in a big city and one day sees Carol, a petite, ex-dancer approaching her 30th birthday.  Utterly captivated, Warren savours every intimate detail. He keeps a hair brush with wisps of her hair in his flat and her clothes in his wardrobe.  When she rows with her partner, he is there, when she kisses another man, he is there. When she gets pregnant he is almost the first to know.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n1 continuous mp3 at 320kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c1aa1ae5b4b891ab888ec08e9c08fe04a33f05","amp;dn":"Walk+Right+By+Me+read+by+Gary+Oldman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c1aa1ae5b4b891ab888ec08e9c08fe04a33f05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,193,170,26,229,180,184,145,171,136,142,192,142,156,8,254,4,163,63,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
