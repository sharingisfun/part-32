Every day thousands of men, women and children attempt to enter the United States illegally -- some looking for work, some seeking a new life and others trying to smuggle drugs or other contraband. Many will do whatever it takes, often risking their lives by crossing Arizona's treacherous Sonoran Desert. Now, follow the officers and agents who struggle every day to defend this border.\n\n\n\n11)  Gang Task Force \nIn this episode of Border Wars, Miami and Puerto Rico, agents and officers with the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration intercept a boat with a multi-million dollar drug load, apprehend an alleged member of a transnational gang, and destroy a marijuana grow house. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from a violent gang task force apprehend an alleged member of a dangerous gang to see if he will give them valuable inside information. Hours later, a DEA agent leads a raid on a marijuana grow house operation in West Palm Beach. At the same time, off the coast of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepts a fishing boat carrying what turns out to be more than 500 pounds of cocaine\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/9419/borderwarsseason2screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1952 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 50.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b0ad78796d7f9df17babc8ec0682d41be87431","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Border+Wars+Season+2+11of12+Gang+Task+Force+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b0ad78796d7f9df17babc8ec0682d41be87431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,176,173,120,121,109,127,157,241,123,171,200,236,6,130,212,27,232,116,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
