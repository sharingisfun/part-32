Replace files as needed.\n\nThese setting files are intended to be used with a wired Xbox 360 controller. They are set up to mimic the control style of the PS2. I have worked very hard to get these controller settings as accurate as possible.\n\nThese settings are set up in a way that you can use the Xbox 360 controller with no need to use the keyboard and mouse.\n\nYou will have to adjust the display settings for your machine.  I made the display settings the lowest resolution and default draw distance, because every PC and user is different.\n\nFIRST - Open the Xpadder folder and make sure your controller is recognized.  In Xpadder, click &quot;Open&quot; and select the &quot;My Controller (XBOX 360 for Windows)&quot; controller.\n\nNEXT - Open the &quot;GTA III and Vice City PS2 Style Controls for Xbox 360 Wired Controller&quot; Xpadder profile.\n\nEverything is setup in Xpadder already, no need to change anything.\n\nTHIRD - Start up GTA 3 or Vice City and play. I have extensively tested these settings to match the PS2 style controls. I have played multiple missions and have done multiple things. These controls are in my opinion perfect and flawless.\n\nAgain, thanks for downloading.  I'm glad I could help people with this.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Ziero_1986\n\nP.S. - Also works well with the Back To The Future: Liberty City mod for GTA III, as it doesn't seem to interfere with any keyboard commands that the mod uses. You still have to use the keyboard for mod related commands, such as spawning time machines and using the time circuits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9563a0f2a11d8c7ace9d17a2075a2d1255ed1d6","amp;dn":"Xbox+360+Controller+setting+for+GTA+3+and+VC+on+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9563a0f2a11d8c7ace9d17a2075a2d1255ed1d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,86,58,15,42,17,216,199,172,233,209,122,32,117,162,209,37,94,209,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
