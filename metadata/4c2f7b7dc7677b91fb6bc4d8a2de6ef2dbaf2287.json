He is an unemployed, middle-aged man hanging around with a bunch of teenagers. He feels even worse when he finds out that he is the only one who doesn't know about Riley and the Initiative. Feeling useless and insecure, he runs into Ethan Rayne, but the confrontation ends in drinks at the local pub rather than the usual fisticuffs. The next morning, Giles looks in the mirror and discovers he's woken up as a demon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2f7b7dc7677b91fb6bc4d8a2de6ef2dbaf2287","amp;dn":"Buffy+The+Vampire+Slayer+S04E12+-+A+New+Man.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2f7b7dc7677b91fb6bc4d8a2de6ef2dbaf2287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,47,123,125,199,103,123,145,251,107,196,216,162,222,110,242,219,175,34,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
