Now, Ben Macintyre reveals the extraordinary truth in a documentary based on his bestselling book.\n\nIn 1943, British intelligence hatched a daring plan. As the Allies prepared to invade Sicily, their purpose was to convince the Germans that Greece was the real target. The plot to fool the Fuhrer was the brainchild of Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond.\n\nBritish agents procured the body of a tramp and reinvented his entire identity. He was given a new name, an officer rank and a briefcase containing plans for a fake invasion of Greece. The body was floated off the Spanish coast where Nazi spies would find it.\n\nThe deception was an astonishing success. Hitler fell for it totally, ordering his armies to Greece to await an invasion that never happened. Meanwhile, the Allies landed in Sicily with minimal resistance. The island fell in a month. The war turned in the Allies' favour.\n\nTogether with original witnesses, Macintyre recreates the remarkable story of how one brilliant team, and one dead tramp, pulled off a deception which changed the course of history.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wllmb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wllmb&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nSource: PDTV\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1404 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 644 MB\nSubtitles: merged\n\nSRT available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9e075a29fd07f9c6b29121d36c0b93e65fee1e","amp;dn":"BBC+Operation+Mincemeat+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9e075a29fd07f9c6b29121d36c0b93e65fee1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,158,7,90,41,253,7,249,198,178,145,33,211,108,11,147,230,95,238,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
