Hard to believe, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Texas power trio Mothership, whose self-titled debut album is out today from Ripple Music. In a style where so many acts either ape the classics or the flavor du jour, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refreshing to hear a band who have an instantly recognizable sound, one that draws on 40 rich years of heavy rock but isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reverential about it. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of post-Sabbath, Orange Goblin-ish chromatic riffage, but without the death-rattle vocals. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a compliment to say that there actually a couple of tracks here that could have been radio hits back in the 70s, when a couple of obvious reference points, Blue Oyster Cult and Molly Hatchet were peaking. Guitarist Kelley Juett is the real deal, capable of rapidfire Adrian Smith/Dave Murray runs but more likely to bend notes into the ozone and build a tune like Buck Dharma, or go surrealistically screaming in the same vein as NektarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roye Albrighton. JuettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bassist brother Kyle and drummer Judge Smith keep it low to the ground with a cast-iron swing, without cluttering the arrangements.\n\nThe opening instrumental, Hallucination, has a long intro that nicks Pink FloydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Welcome to the Machine before the first  fuzztone riff kicks in, multitracked bluesmetal  riffage with a neat Hendrix allusion kicking off a doublespeed stampede. Cosmic Rain is heavy Texas boogie as BOC might have done it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ think BuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Boogie, but more creepy and sludgy, the bass kicking off a Maidenesque interlude that finally gets an overamped wah guitar solo.\n\nCity Nights motors along with a vintage Molly Hatchet groove, sounding straight out of 1978, with a wickedly haphazard guitar solo running down the scale and obliterating everything in its path. From there they segue into Angel of Death and its Motorhead-meets-BOC assault.\n\nWin or Lose is not the Sham 69 classic but an original, sort of the KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Superman as Sabbath might have done it and a clinic in good, smart, heavy guitar: slurry chromatic riffage, East Coast boogie, nonchalantly maniacal tremolo-picking and acid blues. Elenin works a fast/slow Maiden dynamic for all itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth, through a squalling, psychedelic end-of-the-world scenario.\n\nEagle Soars blends Texas boogie and Sabbath into a crunchy, menacing roar. The album ends with Lunar Master, a hallucinatory biker epic that nicks the long interlude from MaidenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner, right down to the tasty bass solo and a zillion menacing, echoey layers of guitars as the song rises again. The vinyl record (!!!) and cd each come with a download card and a poster; youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to supply your own hooch. And you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be a metalhead to like this: much as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loud and trippy, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also catchy as hell. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ask the devil to send them to New York and book them into St. Vitus. This is something I have been lagging in posting anyway its here so check it out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cafbe356c91c621bb0ed2e0727bbc6bd5b081cdd","amp;dn":"Mothership-Mothership+320k+mp3++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cafbe356c91c621bb0ed2e0727bbc6bd5b081cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,251,227,86,201,28,98,27,176,237,46,7,39,187,198,189,91,8,28,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
