When contestants are issued challenges, they enter the tournament via a special bluetooth headset. At a museum in Boston, Mai Shiranui and her boyfriend Iori Yagami attend a private unveiling of three relics: The Kagura Mirror, the Yagami Necklace and the Kusanagi Sword. All three relics are believed to have the capability to open a portal into another dimension, where the mystical entity known as the Orochi resides. Legend says that whoever controls the Orochi will be granted limitless powers. Suddenly, Rugal Bernstein storms into the exhibit, shooting at everyone in sight and slashing Chizuru Kagura in the stomach with the Kusanagi Sword before running off with all three relics. He uses his blood and that of Chizuru to open a portal and disappear before he is captured. However, the sword does not vanish with him. It is revealed to Mai by Chizuru that the sword is a fake, and only Saisyu Kusanagi knows the whereabouts of the real sword. Chizuru also warns Mai that she alone must defeat Rugal and that Iori should not be involved. Mai heads to a mental institution, where Saisyu has resided for the past 10 years and remains in a catatonic state. There, she meets his son, Kyo Kusanagi, who is unfamiliar with Chizuru or the stolen relics. She leaves the room and heads to her car, while Kyo puts his father to bed and reads him a book of proverbs. Mai decides to stay in her car in front of the institution until the next morning, when Iori meets her there. When they return to Saisyu's room, Iori's presence suddenly breaks Saisyu's catatonic state, and the elder Kusanagi threatens to kill Iori before losing consciousness and dying. Meanwhile, at another hospital where Chizuru is recovering from her injury, she is informed by her colleague Scott that Rugal has altered the King of Fighters database and issued challenges to all fighters around the world. Mature and Vice are lured in and defeated by Rugal, who makes them his servants.\n\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n\nRelease date: 26 August 2010 (Singapore)\n\ncast\n\n* Sean Faris\n* Maggie Q\n* Will Yun Lee\n* Ray Park\n* FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§oise Yip\n* Monique Ganderton\n* David Leitch\n* Sam Hargrave\n* Bernice Liu\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: The King of Fighters 2010 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1738.30 MiB\nDuration: 1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 623 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56619739798852592391.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/56619739798852592391.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/42709013335300705111.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/42709013335300705111.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66458709259913462710.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66458709259913462710.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/01865416725255186170.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/01865416725255186170.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21871362149307773854.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/21871362149307773854.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow us on Facebook  \n\nFollow us on Twitter ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f5aaa30bbf7858d1ed3568b10f4cdc1a4f7a26","amp;dn":"The+King+of+Fighters+2010+720p+BRRip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Rele","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f5aaa30bbf7858d1ed3568b10f4cdc1a4f7a26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,245,170,163,11,191,120,88,209,237,53,104,177,15,76,220,26,79,122,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
