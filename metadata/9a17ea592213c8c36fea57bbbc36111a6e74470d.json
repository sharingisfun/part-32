But the strings here are luckily more modern, more\navant-garde, offering a great contrast with the free jazz musicians, sometimes\nlimiting themselves to pizzicato chattering in the background, sometimes driving\nheavy unisono lines accentuating the jazz solos, with an especially gloomy and\nmenacing counterpoint in the long &quot;Dr. Badguy&quot;. The overall effect is utterly\nbizarre, creating a kind of busyness which is too much to grasp at once, because\nthere is too much going on, but still in a coherent way, following its own\nlogic. The jazz dominates, and it's great as you can expect from these artists\nand there are times, especially in the longer pieces that the strings let them\ndo their thing, leaving some breathing space, but never for long : there they\nare again, to chase the jazz quartet forward, jabb it in the sides, kick it\nback, emphasize it, play along in moments of frenzy, move it to weird territory,\nor offer shades and an overall darkness that is highly unusual, to say the\nleast. Without specifically saying that the string quartet would represent the\ncold futuristic logic of the evil scientist and the jazz band the proponents of\nlove and free expression (or female vs male :-), at least the tension between\ngood and bad and the overall mood of the film is well-captured by the concept of\nthe double band. And the music is excellent to. Like Parker's &quot;Requiem&quot;, this is\none you should listen to often before you can appreciate it to the full.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a17ea592213c8c36fea57bbbc36111a6e74470d","amp;dn":"William+Parker+Double+Quartet+-+Alphaville+Suite+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a17ea592213c8c36fea57bbbc36111a6e74470d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,23,234,89,34,19,200,195,111,234,87,187,188,54,17,26,110,116,71,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
