ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Number 1 app in more than 25 countries including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia and across Europe.\n\nWith more than 15 million songs and 3 million artists in the world of music how do you find the music you like? We built Discovr Music to make it easy to find and explore new music. Enter an artist you like and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover artists you love.\n\nThe app uses data visualization and music recommendations to provide an interactive map of the entire world of music. You can navigate through the musical ecosystem and discover new music based on what you like. The app is built from the ground up to make the most of OSX Lion, and is also backwards compatible to Snow Leopard.\n\nDiscovr lets you see how the music you love is connected, and makes it easy to find great new bands and artists that are similar to what you like. To get started simply type in the name of a band or artist that you love and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll show you some similar music to check out. Bands or artists that are similar are connected. Just click on one you like and the map will grow organically to show other similar artists. You can double click on a band or artist to see more info about them. Watch their videos, check out their bio, or read the latest reviews and blogs about their music. When you discover a band or artist you like you can share it with your friends via Twitter or Facebook or save it to your favorites.\n\nDiscovr is brought to you by Filter Squad. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a little startup from Australia. We also make Discovr Apps to help you find new apps. Discovr Music is powered by The Echo Nest.\n\n\n\nFOLLOW ME IN TWITTER: @dimasconex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8533c7241cb4195daf3cb88ae75c08fe74e2d2d4","amp;dn":"Discovr+Music+%28v2.1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8533c7241cb4195daf3cb88ae75c08fe74e2d2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,51,199,36,28,180,25,93,175,60,184,138,231,92,8,254,116,226,210,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
