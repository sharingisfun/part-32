Thanks mainly to the outstanding quality of their leader, Santana the band has so far been able to withstand any attempt at pigeonholing their musical style, an elaborate fusion of blues, soul, hard rock, Latin American and Afro-Cuban sounds, gypsy, jazz, and folk. Not even the confines of a four-minute single will suffice to scale down Santana's magic. Over 40 million records sold, more than 100 live shows per year, concerts attended by a total of over 20 million people - Santana is an untiring laborer driven by an enormous spiritual energy. For over thirty years he's been delivering his message to the world: We Are All One. &quot;Everybody gets wet when it rains, from the prostitute to the pope. My music strives to communicate that message of unity.&quot; Utmost virtuosity, a spot-on feeling for taste, and an infallible instinct for brilliant songs lend Santana's live shows the highest entertainment factor imaginable.Carlos Santana (g, voc), Tommy Anthony (rhythm g), Chester Thompson (kb), Benny Rietfeld (b), Karl Perazzo (timbales, voc), Paul Rekow (con), Tony Lindsay &amp; Andy Vargas (lead voc), Jeff Cressman (tb), Bill Ortiz (tp), Dennis Chambers (dr) Jingo -- Life Is For Living -- Curacion (Sunlight On Water) -- El Farol -- Shape Shifter -- Right On -- Umi Says -- Smooth -- Novus -- I Love You Too Much -- Somewhere In Heaven -- I Believe It's Time -- Superstition -- Serpents And Doves -- Maria Maria -- Praise -- Into The Night recorded live at The Fillmore, San Francisco, May 20 &amp; 21, 2008\n\nTrack List:\n\n1.
