Although Ayers' symbolic banana references find their way into the title (the banana being his outlet for representing silliness in such a serious world ), the ten tracks find him singing some rather conventional pop/rock. \n\nBoth &quot;Star&quot; and &quot;Mr. Cool&quot; were released as singles, with some noticeable guitar work from Ollie Halsall adorning both. Ayers made a name for himself by incorporating a unique brand of genial eccentricity into his music -- 1970s Joy of a Toy and 1973's Bananamour, for example, as &quot;The Ballad of Mr. Snake&quot; and &quot;The Owl&quot; are typical of Ayers' discounted vaudeville-like fair. On the whole, MaÃƒÂ±anas has Ayers sounding more mature, which could account for the album's slight downfall. Even with Billy Livsey's keyboard ritziness, efforts like &quot;Love's Gonna Turn You Around,&quot; &quot;Falling in Love Again,&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; are shy of Ayers' off-centeredness -- and the absence of this trait to some extent gives MaÃƒÂ±anas a slightly colder feel than his earlier work. Two years later, Kevin Ayers released the more appealing Rainbow Takeaway, but he still wasn't his old self.\n\nCardboard sleeve reissue from Kevin Ayers features remastering in 2014 and the high-fidelity SHM-CD format (compatible with standard CD players). The cover faithfully replicates the original UK LP artwork. Includes an obi featuring design of original Japanese limited edition's LP (subject to change). Comes with a description and lyrics. Part of eight-album Kevin Ayers cardboard sleeve reissue series features the albums, &quot;Joy Of A Toy +5,&quot; &quot;Shooting At The Moon +6,&quot; &quot;Whatevershebrings Wesing +10,&quot; &quot;Bananamour +7,&quot; &quot;Odd Ditties +3,&quot; &quot;Yes We Have No Mananas.
