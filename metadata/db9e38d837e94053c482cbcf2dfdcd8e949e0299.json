He critically examines the view--very widely accepted by scientists, social scientists and philosophers of science--that heritability estimates have no causal implications and are devoid of any interest and subjects the arguments to close philosophical scrutiny. His conclusion is that anti-heritability arguments are based on conceptual confusions and misunderstandings of behavioral genetics.\n\n282 pages\nSeries: Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Biology\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (November 14, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 052182818X\nISBN-13: 978-0521828185","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9e38d837e94053c482cbcf2dfdcd8e949e0299","amp;dn":"Making+Sense+of+Heritability+%282005%29+by+Neven+Sesardic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9e38d837e94053c482cbcf2dfdcd8e949e0299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,158,56,216,55,233,64,83,196,130,203,207,45,253,205,142,148,158,2,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
