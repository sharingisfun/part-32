After that intro, however, the rest of the album progresses to become the heir apparent to Mineral's evolution. In fact, Start Here far surpasses anything Mineral did, or the Gloria Record has done up to this point themselves. After a few listens, the strength of lead singer Chris Simpson's voice begins to penetrate into your head like a siren. The keyboards are effortlessly worked into the songs and, from track to track, Start Here flows like the weeks of the year. Occasionally the songs are melancholic and gloomy like winter, other times full of hope and grace like summer, but behind them all are power, strength, beauty, and the knowledge that this might be the closest anyone can get to heaven while still in the flesh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f66f8fb1ce398c464f52c3aeca1ea0d09acfa2a","amp;dn":"The+Gloria+Record+-+Start+Here+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f66f8fb1ce398c464f52c3aeca1ea0d09acfa2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,102,248,251,28,227,152,196,100,245,44,58,236,161,234,13,9,172,250,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
