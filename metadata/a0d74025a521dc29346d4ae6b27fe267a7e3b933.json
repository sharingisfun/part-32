They emerged from the same Los Angeles scene that spawned Van Halen, MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e, Dokken, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Guns N' Roses, Great White, L.A. Guns and others. The band's popularity peaked in the 1980s, yet they continue to record and tour, making them one of the most enduring of the West Coast heavy metal bands. W.A.S.P. gained notoriety for their shock rock themed image, lyrics and live performances. They have sold over 12 million copies of their albums.\r\nThe band became notorious for its raunchy and shocking live shows. Lawless would  tie semi-naked models to a torture rack, and  also hurl raw meat into the audience. The band's debut single, &quot;Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)&quot;, and its cover were equally controversial.(Included).\r\n\r\nThey recorded their third album, titled Inside the Electric Circus. It was released in October 1986. The album was a big hit with W.A.S.P. fans. Critics, on the other hand, dismissed it as &quot;7th-grader rock&quot;. Songs like &quot;Shoot From The Hip&quot; and the minor hit single &quot;95-N.A.S.T.Y.&quot; helped the band live up to the reputation of one of the possible meanings of their band name, &quot;We Are Sexual Perverts&quot;. However, Blackie Lawless himself, known to be a harsh critic of his own work, cited in the album's re-release liner notes that Inside the Electric Circus was &quot;[a] tired record by a tired band&quot;. Ultimately it was an unfavorable critical review of the single &quot;95-N.A.S.T.Y.&quot; that convinced Lawless to take some time off and reconsider the band's creative direction.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01.
