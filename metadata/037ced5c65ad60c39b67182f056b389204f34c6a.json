Running the total length takes about 40 to 50 minutes.\r\nIt is beautifully modeled and very realistic, perfectly capturing the atmosphere of Alaska's cold and remote regions. It offers possibilities for all kinds of scenarios, having passenger stations, logging camps, coal loaders, container loaders, etc.\r\n\r\nThe route comes with PierreG's custom-made assets, including planes, ships, canoes, snowmobiles and even bears ready to eat your lunch and/or you.\r\n\r\n3 freeroam scenarios are provided, and a scenario pack by Belux Trains is a separate download, including 10 standard scenarios also included.\r\n\r\nThis is a repackaged version of the original route published on railsim-fr.com here: \nhttp://www.railsim-fr.com/forum/index.php?app=downloads&amp;showfile=832.\r\n\r\nYou will need to have Donner Pass installed to play. \r\n\r\nThis includes all rolling stock in the Alaska Livery and is now quick driveable as well as with all images. It has been tested working with everything in TS2016. Just install and have fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037ced5c65ad60c39b67182f056b389204f34c6a","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+The+Great+North+Route+v1.1+in+RWP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037ced5c65ad60c39b67182f056b389204f34c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,124,237,92,101,173,96,195,155,103,24,47,5,107,56,146,4,243,76,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
