The producers paid nearly as much attention to the audio as the stunning visuals, but this soundtrack is slightly uneven. Baseball errs on the side of good taste a bit too often, what with contributions from Bruce Hornsby, Carly Simon, and Natalie Cole peppered amid classics by the likes of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. The well-chosen historical material--including calls spanning five full decades--should interest die-hard fans, though. --David Sprague \n\n   1.
