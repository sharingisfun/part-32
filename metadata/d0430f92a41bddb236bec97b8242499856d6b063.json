To combat the monsters, a special type of weapon is designed: massive, humanoid fighting machines, known as Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are bound in a neural link which lets them share the mental strain which would otherwise overwhelm a single pilot.[6]\n\nThe Jaeger program is initially successful in fending off Kaiju attacks and at first turns the tide of the war. However, over time, Kaijus cross through the portal at a faster rate, with each new Kaiju becoming increasingly well-adapted for fighting the Jaegers. As such, the robots become less effective, causing the now-united governments of Earth to lose faith in the Jaegers' ability to defend humanity. The Jaeger program is terminated, with resources diverted to building the &quot;Wall of Life&quot;, a coastal fortification to protect Earth's cities. The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to Hong Kong to defend the unfortified coastline until the wall can be completed. Stacker Pentecost, commander of the Jaeger forces, devises a plan to end the war with an illegally-acquired Russian nuclear warhead.\n\nPentecost approaches former pilot Raleigh Becket and convinces him to return to the program. Becket and his brother Yancy had once been pilots of Gipsy Danger and tasked with defending the Alaskan coastline. During a mission, they ignored an order and engaged a Kaiju directly. Yancy was killed while connected to his brother, traumatizing Raleigh. Upon returning to the program, Raleigh undergoes a rigorous process of testing to find a new co-pilot, since the stronger the connection between two pilots, the better their performance in battle. Raleigh demands to be partnered with Mako Mori, a test pilot whose participation Pentecost opposes, as Mako is his adoptive daughter. He eventually relents and allows her to partner Raleigh. The duo's initial test run nearly ends in disaster when Mako gets caught up in a childhood memory of a Kaiju attack; she inadvertently activates and nearly discharges Gipsy Danger's weapons system while in the hangar. The duo are withdrawn from the field indefinitely as the remaining Jaegers are tasked with fending off a double Kaiju attack. The defense of Hong Kong goes poorly, with the Kaijus quickly destroying two Jaegers and disabling a third. Pentecost has no choice but to authorize Raleigh and Mako to mount a last stand, and the duo drive off the assault.\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat                                   : Flash Video\nFile size                                : 484 MiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 1mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 556 Kbps\nTagging application                      : Yet Another Metadata Injector for FLV - Version 1.9\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;377f5e505f777b041907&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : 7\nDuration                                 : 2h 1mn\nBit rate                                 : 500 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 660 pixels\nHeight                                   : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.2:1\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 29.023 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.086\nStream size                              : 443 MiB (91%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 118\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 10\nDuration                                 : 2h 1mn\nBit rate                                 : 43.8 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 16.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDelay relative to video                  : 34ms\nStream size                              : 40.3 MiB (8%)\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0430f92a41bddb236bec97b8242499856d6b063","amp;dn":"Pacific+Rim+CAM.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0430f92a41bddb236bec97b8242499856d6b063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,67,15,146,164,27,221,178,54,190,201,123,130,66,73,152,86,214,176,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
