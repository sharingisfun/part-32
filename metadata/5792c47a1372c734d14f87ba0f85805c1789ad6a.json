Their 2011 album has a sound akin to Foo FightersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ self-titled debut and SugarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s File Under: Easy Listening, playing just like an alternative rock/punk-pop hybrid from the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s. Like Samiam's career highlight, 1994Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Clumsy, this album is a slick and refined outing, full of straightforward, sweet melodies, yearning lyrics, and energetic riffs in an upbeat tempo. Iggy Pop/Green Day producer Chris Dugan recorded Trips onto 2&quot; tape at Green Day's personal studio Jingletown in San Francisco, California, and this Ã¢â‚¬Å“back to basicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ method is a perfect fit for the traditional craftsmanship. The songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“September,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crew of One,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“MagellanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are solid power pop songs that show that Beebout, Kennerly, Loobkoff, Bouchard, and Walker still know how to rock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5792c47a1372c734d14f87ba0f85805c1789ad6a","amp;dn":"Samiam+-+Trips+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5792c47a1372c734d14f87ba0f85805c1789ad6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,146,196,122,19,114,199,52,209,79,135,186,15,133,128,92,23,137,173,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
