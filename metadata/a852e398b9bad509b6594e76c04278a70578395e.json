And being an assassin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the only profession fit for an outcast Ã¢â‚¬â€œ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help matters. But sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never brought her work home. Until now.\n\n    Her latest mission is uncomfortably complex, and threatens the fragile peace between the vampire and mage races. As Sabina scrambles to figure out which side sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on, she uncovers a tangled political web, some nasty facts about her family and some unexpected new talents. Any of these things could be worryingly life-changing, but together, they could be fatal Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n    This time, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal.\n\n01 - Red-Headed Stepchild\n02 - The Mage in Black\n03 - Green-Eyed Demon\n04 - Silver Tongued Devil\n05 - Blue-Blooded Vamp\n\n\n\nBook 5 is my only rip - the rest are gathered from other downloads.  My thanks to the original up-loaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a852e398b9bad509b6594e76c04278a70578395e","amp;dn":"Jaye+Wells+Sabina+Kane+Books+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a852e398b9bad509b6594e76c04278a70578395e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,82,227,152,185,186,213,9,182,89,78,118,192,66,120,167,5,120,57,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
