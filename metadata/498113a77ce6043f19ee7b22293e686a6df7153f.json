The student centered nature of the book is further enhanced by reflective question breaks throughout the text; chapter summaries; suggested further reading and web sites; and a glossary of key terms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498113a77ce6043f19ee7b22293e686a6df7153f","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2006%5D+Theories+of+Crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498113a77ce6043f19ee7b22293e686a6df7153f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,129,19,167,124,230,4,63,25,238,123,34,41,62,104,106,109,247,21,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
