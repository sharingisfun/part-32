It's pointless to say &quot;if you like this kind of music, get it&quot;--because there isn't really anything to compare it with. Sure, it's kind of folk, has some attitude, it's acoustic, etc. etc. but the musical content and lyrics cannot be pigeonholed. These songs are real compositions and are definitely not written according to any formula common to popular music. How three sisters so young could be so original is beyond me, but I'm happy because of it. If you listen carefully, you will notice that they don't do anything in a song the same way twice. The music is always developing, changing. That is one of the signs of great writing. The lyrics speak of commonplace things (relationships, jobs) in new, original ways. In &quot;Hammond Song,&quot; we don't know exactly to whom they are talking nor do we know exactly where Hammond is. But it makes no difference. We can fill in the blanks, and to listen to what they do with the musical arrangement is spellbinding.\n\nIf you are just learning about the Roches this is the place to start. This and their other early albums are the place to start. Unfortunately some of their later efforts are weaker, in my opinion. They seemed to lose that touch of attitude and sass that made me call them &quot;subversive&quot; artists in their early recordings. They hook you in with their sweet sounds and then stick the knife in when you are off guard. There is definitely a touch of irony to their early work. Listen and learn!\n\n\nimage\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoches, The - The Roches (Warner 3298)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Roches, The\nAlbum................: The Roches (Warner 3298)\nGenre................: Folk\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1979\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 52 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
