Elsewhere in the city, an ordinary woman with superhuman strength and a rapacious appetite attacks a group of teenagers. Eight women have disappeared over the past few days, and the police fear they may have a serial killer on their hands, but as the body count rises and the hungers grow, the Torchwood team realise there may be something much more dangerous than a serial killer at work. This title features characters from BBC&amp;#039;s &quot;Torchwood&quot;, as played by John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Naoko Mori, Burn Gorman and Gareth David-Lloyd. This is an abridged audiobook of the novel by Andy Lane\n\n\nRunning time : 3 Hours - 18 Minutes\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c2a07bb79af69cd4f304fb1aa576b3bf2a41723","amp;dn":"Torchwood+-+Slow+Decay+-+iPod+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c2a07bb79af69cd4f304fb1aa576b3bf2a41723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,42,7,187,121,175,105,205,79,48,79,177,170,87,107,59,242,164,23,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
