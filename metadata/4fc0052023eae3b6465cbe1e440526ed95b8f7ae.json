Born September 26, 1945, in Washington, England, Ferry, the son of a coal miner, began his musical career as a singer with the rock outfit the Banshees while studying art at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne under pop conceptualist Richard Hamilton. He later joined the Gas Board, a soul group featuring bassist Graham Simpson; in 1970, Ferry and Simpson formed Roxy Music. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Virgin 7243 8 49585 2 7 HDCD\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Slave To Love\n02.Jealous Guy\n03.This Love\n04.More Than This\n05.Falling In Love Again\n06.Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\n07.Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n08.Oh Yeah\n09.Is Your Love Strong Enough\n10.Zamba\n11.These Foolish Things\n12.Crazy Love\n13.Sonnet 18\n14.Avalon\n15.Where Or When\n16.To Turn You On\n17.Windswept\n18.My Only Love\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc0052023eae3b6465cbe1e440526ed95b8f7ae","amp;dn":"Bryan+Ferry+-+The+Best+Of+The+Ballads+%282000%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc0052023eae3b6465cbe1e440526ed95b8f7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,192,5,32,35,234,227,182,70,92,190,30,68,5,38,237,149,184,247,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
