Clark astronomical observatory Star Lab. Here, Star Lab research director Mora Cassiday, along with scientists and technicians of the International Space Authority, watch over the countless suns, planets and star systems that fill the universe.&quot;\n\nAlien Worlds was produced and broadcast in 1979 and deals with the interplanetary peacekeepers on Star Lab. It was created by Lee Hansen, who also produced and directed all 26 broadcast episodes in two seasons. The series was syndicated and both seasons were often broadcast back-to-back. \n\nThe science fiction show was first syndicated by Watermark Inc. after Lee Hansen was hired as their creative director. After advancing the concept of an action-adventure dramatic radio series, Lee began developing the concept in the fall of 1978. Watermark premiered the first episode, &quot;The Sun Stealers&quot;, on January 7, 1979.\n\nThe series gained popularity thanks to its relatable characters, full symphonic soundtrack, realistic sound effects, high production values and documentary style format. Eventually over 500 top-rated US FM radio stations, along with stations in New Zealand and Australia aired the series. Between 1979 and 1980, 26 half-hour programs were broadcast at various times on weekends, where they gained favorable worldwide press acclaim. Alien Worlds was soon heard on a weekly basis by millions of fans and was eventually carried by over 1500 top-rated FM radio stations worldwide. The series' sponsor was Peter Paul, Cadbury which advertised Cadbury Caramello chocolates touting their caramel centers.The ISA, or International Space Authority, is a governing body of space development and exploration.
