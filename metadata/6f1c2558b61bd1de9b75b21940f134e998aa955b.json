I loved it as a kid and I love it now. It was great to see that it is now out on DVD.\n\nThe compilation contains the following six episodes:\n\nFrench Fried\nRussia Hour\nSwiss Missed\nTo Kilimanjaro Bird\nDon't Break the China\nRocky Mountain Lie\nas well as the music video 'Yummy, Yummy, Yummy'.\n\nThe show is far more comic than the films (which of course are far superior) and are great fun. This is a great choice of episodes and each one is very entertaining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1c2558b61bd1de9b75b21940f134e998aa955b","amp;dn":"Dining+Out+With+Timon+And+Pumbaa+-+Norsk+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1c2558b61bd1de9b75b21940f134e998aa955b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,28,37,88,182,27,209,222,155,117,178,25,64,241,52,233,152,170,149,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
