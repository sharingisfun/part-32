DeMatteis, Giuseppe Camuncoli, and Sal Buscema!\n\nPublished by DC\n\nCover by Giuseppe Camuncoli\nWritten by J.M. DeMatteis\nArt by Giuseppe Camuncoli, Sal Buscema\nColored by Tony Avina\n\nGenres: Anthology, Superhero\n\n23 Pages\nDigital Release Date: 05/20/2013\nAge Rating: 12+ Only\n\n------\n\nThe first upload with my TPB green skull! I'm honored, though I just can't upload much at all now. (But no captcha to enter... wooohooo!)\n\nThis new issue of the new Superman digital comic is a great way to share my never-ending enjoyment of great comics. If you aren't reading Adventures of Superman, give it a try. So far, every issue has had a self-contained story starring the classic, red-trunks Supes. And DeMatteis &amp; Buscema (although he's inking Camuncoli) are a flashback to a great run on Spectacular Spider-Man!\n\nAll credit goes to Cypher-Empire. Enjoy!  --STFmaryville","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db6ae5637f10475e8f0a8910140d01cade09aa0","amp;dn":"ADVENTURES+OF+SUPERMAN+004+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28Cypher-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db6ae5637f10475e8f0a8910140d01cade09aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,182,174,86,55,241,4,117,232,240,168,145,1,64,208,28,173,224,154,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
