I. Markushevich in the  Little Mathematics Library.\n\nThe book acquaints the reader with complex numbers and functions of a complex argument (including Zhukovsky's function as applied to the construction of a wing section). The material is presented in a geometric form. Complex numbers are considered as directed line segments and functions as mappings. To prepare the reader to such an understanding of complex numbers, we begin with a geometric interpretation of real numbers and operations on them. The book is based on a lecture delivered by the author to high-school students. To read the book, the reader need not be acquainted with complex numbers.\n\n    It is intended for all those who are\n    interested in mathematics and primarily for high-school\n    students, it can also be of use for self-education. For proper\n    comprehension of the content of the book the reader must posses\n    high-school knowledge of mathematics.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by Irene Aleksanova and was first published by Mir in 1982.\n\nPDF | OCR | Cover | Bookmarked | 4.4 MB | 68 pp | 600 dpi\n\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n\nContents:\n\nForeword\n1.
