Paul became internationally famous for correctly &quot;predicting&quot; the winner of Germany's seven matches at the 2010 World Cup, as well as the final, with no errors.\n\nDuring the divinations, Paul was presented with two boxes containing food in the form of a mussel, each box marked with the flag of a national football team in an upcoming match. He chose the box with the flag of the winning team in four of Germany's six Euro 2008 matches, and in all seven of their matches in the 2010 World Cup. He correctly predicted a win for Spain against the Netherlands in the World Cup final on 11 July by eating the mussel in the box with the Spanish flag on it.[1] His predictions were 100% (8/8) correct for the 2010 World Cup and 86% (12/14) correct overall. Paul was retired after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nA song about Paul the Octopus..............we love Paul!\nEnjoy this one :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9b9e9b1a0ce62de39d3b5bc156373e0aa10f8b","amp;dn":"Parry+Gripp+-+Paul+the+Octopus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9b9e9b1a0ce62de39d3b5bc156373e0aa10f8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,155,158,155,26,12,230,45,227,157,59,91,193,86,55,62,10,161,15,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
