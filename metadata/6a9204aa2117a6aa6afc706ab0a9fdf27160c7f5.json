The first feature-length documentary about lesbian and gay identity made by gay filmmakers, the film had a huge impact when it was released and became an icon of the emerging gay rights movement of the 1970s.\n\nIn honor of its place in our collective history, Word is Out was selected for the LEGACY PROJECT FOR GLBT FILM PRESERVATION by Outfest and the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive. The original film negative was recently restored, and the re-mastered 35 mm print was shown at gala festival events at OUTFEST in Los Angeles and FRAMELINE in San Francisco.\n\nThe 30th anniversary DVD has been mastered from the restored 35mm theatrical version of the film and supervised by Ross Lipman of the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive and the Mariposa Film Group. The DVD also includes exclusive updates on the cast and the filmmakers, and an homage to Peter Adair, originator and inspired producer of Word is Out, who died of AIDS in 1996.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9204aa2117a6aa6afc706ab0a9fdf27160c7f5","amp;dn":"Word.Is.Out%3A+stories.of.some.of.our.lives+%2830th+anniversary%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9204aa2117a6aa6afc706ab0a9fdf27160c7f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,146,4,170,33,23,166,170,106,252,112,106,176,169,253,242,113,96,199,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
