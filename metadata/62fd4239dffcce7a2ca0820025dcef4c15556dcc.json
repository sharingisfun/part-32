St. Louis will never be the same. My wife and I actually attended the festivities and it was one for the ages. Half way through the concert, Michael Anthony of Van Halen fame joins the band and the old VH stuff starts to roll.\n\nCapped from an HD televised presentation and formatted for your viewing pleasure, this 1 hour and 51 minute (approx) concert covers his hits from most of his career....from Montrose to his recent stuff with Anthony. Songs include &quot;Rock Candy&quot;, &quot;Can't Drive 55&quot;, &quot;Mas Tequilla&quot;, &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, and a shit house more!\n\nThis is definitely one the best concerts we've been to in a long time and we know you will enjoy it.\n\n\nformat: xvid, mp3\nResolution: 624 X 352 HD WS\nFrame Rate: 29fps\nRun Time: 01:51:35\n\nRemember to SEED!!\n\n...and, as always...ENJOY!!!\n\n\n...PS: Sorry for the larger size but, we didn't want you to miss anything and we didn't want to degrade the quality.....shit, it was almost 2 hours!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62fd4239dffcce7a2ca0820025dcef4c15556dcc","amp;dn":"Sammy+Hagar+and+the+Wabos+%2ALIVE%2A+in+St.+Louis%2C+MO.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62fd4239dffcce7a2ca0820025dcef4c15556dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,253,66,57,223,252,206,122,44,160,130,0,37,220,239,76,21,85,109,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
