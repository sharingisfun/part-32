She soon learns this new world is nothing like her old one, and she struggles to make a place for herself among the Mohiri. But it soon becomes apparent to Sara and to everyone one around her that she is not your typical warrior. As the weeks pass, Sara builds new relationships, copes with her new trainers, and tries to manage her ever-changing powers while keeping her unique heritage a secret. Looming in the background is the constant shadow of the Master, who will do anything to find her.\r\nSara finds herself on a journey of self-discovery that uncovers her true strengths and awakens a part of her she never knew existed. She experiences the delight of new friendships, the sweetness and pain of first love, and a loss so deep it could be the thing that finally breaks her. At the end of it all, she discovers that the one place she was supposed to be safe might not be the refuge she thought it was","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91d37446ef4133030a014a99789caa58097cdd6b","amp;dn":"Karen+Lynch-Refuge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91d37446ef4133030a014a99789caa58097cdd6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,211,116,70,239,65,51,3,10,1,74,153,120,156,170,88,9,124,221,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
