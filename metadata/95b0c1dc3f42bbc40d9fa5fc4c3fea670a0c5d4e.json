The band is best known for the hit singles &quot;Right Between the Eyes&quot; and &quot;Bridge to Your Heart&quot;.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1981, 10cc were working on what would become their album Ten Out of 10. Andrew Gold was invited to record with the band by Lenny Waronker, head of A&amp;R at Warner Bros. It led to an offer to join the band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an offer Gold declined because of other commitments.[1]\n\nAfter 10cc split in 1983, Gouldman persuaded Gold to return to England to write and spent some time together. He ended up staying for seven months. During this period they wrote enough songs for an album. They chose World In Action as the band name and released a single &quot;Don't Break My Heart&quot;. Soon afterwards they changed the name to Common Knowledge. A second single &quot;Victoria&quot; was released, but both singles failed to get any attention and the album was shelved.[2]\n\nThey started working on songs for a new album, changed labels, and took the name Wax. Wax released three studio albums between 1986 and 1989. Their only British hit was &quot;Bridge to Your Heart&quot; which reached #12 in autumn 1987.[3] A Top of the Pops appearance and a tour followed. The duo were about to split in 1990 when Gouldman was offered the chance to reform 10cc with Eric Stewart. Gold appeared on the comeback album ...Meanwhile playing guitar on &quot;Charity Begins at Home&quot; and sang lead vocal on &quot;Ready to go Home&quot; from 10cc's last album Mirror Mirror, which he had intended to be a guide vocal only - but Eric Stewart liked what he had done with the track and his vocals remained.\n\nIn 1998 their Common Knowledge album was finally released as common knowledge.com with four new tracks under the Wax name. A collection of out-takes and rarities, Wax Bikini was released in 2000 through Gold's website.\n\nGeneral\n\nComplete name : Wax Bridge To Your Heart (Extended).mp3\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFile size : 7.21 MiB\nDuration : 5mn 14s\nOverall bit rate : 192 Kbps\nAlbum : Unknown Album Dance Classics\nTrack name : Bridge To Your Heart (Extended)\nPerformer : Wax\nGenre : Dance Classics\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nDuration : 5mn 14s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nStream size : 7.21 MiB (100%) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95b0c1dc3f42bbc40d9fa5fc4c3fea670a0c5d4e","amp;dn":"Andrew+Gold+-+Wax+-+Bridge+To+Your+Heart+%28Extended%29+-+%281987%29%5BMP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95b0c1dc3f42bbc40d9fa5fc4c3fea670a0c5d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,176,193,220,63,66,187,196,13,159,165,252,76,63,234,103,10,12,93,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
