The book begins with the principles of the two-winding transformer and its connection to polyphase systems, the origins of transformer losses, autotransformers, and three-winding transformers. Different types of transformer coil and coil construction are compared. Later chapters describe the effects of short circuits on transformers, the design and maintenance of ancillary equipment, and both preventative and predictive maintenance practices for extending transformer life.\nAnnotation c.
