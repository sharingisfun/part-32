He toured with them and finally became an &quot;official&quot; member after a decade of touring with them in 1999. That same year, he met blues singer Susan Tedeschi, and the two married in 2001, beginning a family. He continues to play with both The Allman Brothers Band and as bandleader of the The Derek Trucks Band, which he founded at age 15. In recent years, Trucks and Tedeschi have merged their respective bands on occasion, billed as the &quot;Soul Stew Revival&quot;.\n\nTrucks is known best for his dexterity and speciality as a slide guitarist, and stoic focus while performing on stage, his intense interest in the history of roots and blues musicians whose influence can be felt in Trucks' music, along with his familiarity and ability to integrate a wide variety of musical genres. He has played with a number of famous bands and musicians of note, guesting with other artists on tour, in festivals, and recording sessions.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48bb9ddb4e734d111da995d8ba7df1037c9e94c","amp;dn":"Derek+Trucks+-+%5C%27Out+Of+The+Madness%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48bb9ddb4e734d111da995d8ba7df1037c9e94c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,139,185,221,180,231,52,209,17,218,153,93,139,167,223,16,55,201,233,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
