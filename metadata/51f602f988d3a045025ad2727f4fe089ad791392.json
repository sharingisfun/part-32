Scott's attraction to Hank is immediate and mind-blowing, and it's what Scott has always wanted: to know what it's like to love someone he can't live without.\n\nScott needs to know if Hank's true feelings will be a roar of passion or simply a quiet friendship, one that doesn't match Scott's devotion. But it may be too late: Scott simply can't help himself from falling hard for Hank.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51f602f988d3a045025ad2727f4fe089ad791392","amp;dn":"Falling+by+D.W.+Marchwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51f602f988d3a045025ad2727f4fe089ad791392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,246,2,249,136,211,160,69,2,90,210,114,127,79,224,137,173,121,19,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
