Mexico. India. California. All around the world, brutal attacks are crippling entire cities. It isn't the work of terrorists, but of animals, and their somehow coordinated assaults are escalating at a terrifying pace. Jackson Oz, a young biologist, watches the events with an increasing sense of dread. A coordinated lion ambush in Africa demonstrates the enormity of the violence to come. Could it be the beginning of an all-out war on man? With the help of ecologist Chloe Tousignant, Oz races to warn world leaders before it's too late. The attacks are growing in ferocity, and soon there will be no place left for humans to hide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6cf89b1e59cd5ce133629c931ef313a4c640f04","amp;dn":"Zoo+-+The+Graphic+Novel+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6cf89b1e59cd5ce133629c931ef313a4c640f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,207,137,177,229,156,213,206,19,54,41,201,49,239,49,58,76,100,15,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
