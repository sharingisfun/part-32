This ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclassroom in a bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ provides the aspiring cartoonist with a\npractical means for creative self-discovery and the exploration of complex\nideas through the iconic visual language of comics.\nYou will get all the benefits of taking the cartooning course I teach,\nminus the distractions of the instructorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s monotonous, droning voice, chronic\nabsent-mindedness, soporific slideshows, and soul-crushing critiques. The\nseemingly endless tangential exegeses, however, have been retained.\nYou will keep a sketchbook that will function as a journal for notes, observations,\nexperiences, memories, dreams, and anecdotes (and may even\nserve as an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œart objectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in and of itself). You will then develop and translate\nthis material into various cartoon narratives, ranging from the simple construction\nof one-panel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cartoons to a full-fledged multiple-page story.\nAll the while, you will be encouraged to experiment with the wide variety\nof tools and media that can be used to create comics.\nYou will design characters, explore the various rhythms of storytelling\ninherent in the cartooning language, and compose panels, pages, and\nstories. The goal will be to move from rough ideas to initial sketches, and\nthen to use this booklet as a sort of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprocess-oriented workshopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to refine\nthose sketches into finished pieces.\nThis instructional guide will focus as much on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwriting with picturesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as\non developing ability in drawing.\n\nYale University Press\n2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c6100f3750ea90c473417ad3be5348f69ef3cc9","amp;dn":"Cartooning+-+Philosophy+and+Practice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c6100f3750ea90c473417ad3be5348f69ef3cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,97,0,243,117,14,169,12,71,52,23,173,59,229,52,143,105,239,60,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
