He's a griot, descended from a long line of traditional musicians, and there's a confidence and sense of authority to his powerful singing, which can ease between the conversational and declamatory. Most of his songs are self-written and medium paced, with variety provided by his impressive backing musicians, including members of the Symmetric Orchestra. Toumani Diabate makes an appearance playing kora on the exquisite and passionate Nankoumandjian, while the Symmetric's Fantamady Kouyate provides some impressive guitar work, swapping fluid guitar lines with the former Rail Band star Djelimady Tounkara on the rolling Maliba. It's a classy set - and would have been even better if it had included the ngoni hero Bassekou Kouyate, who provided the memorable backing for Kasse Mady at his London concert this week.\n-- The Guardian\n\n\n&quot;MANDEN DJELI KAN is a stunning electric meditation upon a millennium of tradition.&quot;\n-- The Beat\n\n\nWhen feasting upon the many marvellous musical exports that Mali bestows upon the West, it can be difficult to grasp how an artist sits within the context of their own country. Well note this - singer Kasse Mady Diabate is of a 700-year-old dynasty of singers still regarded as royalty in his homeland.\n-- CC (Culture Critic, UK)\n\n\nTrack List\n01- Bandja\n02- Kalou Man Kene\n03- Kaninba\n04- Allah Dounde\n05- Kia Ko Djougou\n06- Douga Djabira\n07- Maliba\n08- Nankoumandjian\n09- Sinanon Saran\n10- Manden Mandinkadenou\n11- Sansan\n\nEAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafariCubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9ae1af3143f14e40eef56a0c085866ebe468c32","amp;dn":"Kasse+Mady+Diabate+-+Manden+Djeli+Kan+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9ae1af3143f14e40eef56a0c085866ebe468c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,174,26,243,20,63,20,228,14,239,86,160,192,133,134,110,190,70,140,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
