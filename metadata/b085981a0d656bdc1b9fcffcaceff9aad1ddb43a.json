This collection includes all of his highly-acclaimed stories for Aces High, EC's famous air war title. As a bonus, we present a rarity: Evans's never-before-reprinted 3-D story of World War I ace Frank Luke (in regular, easy-on-the-eyes 2-D). This volume also includes numerous Evans crime and shock stories, including &quot;As Ye Sow...,&quot; &quot;...My BrotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Keeper,&quot; and &quot;Cadillac Fever.&quot; Other war stories, many done in collaboration with Harvey Kurtzman, include &quot;Napoleon!&quot; and &quot;Flaming Coffins&quot; (which Evans wrote, about the inherent perils of WW I aircraft). Like all books in the Fantagraphics EC line, Aces High features essays and notes by EC experts on these superbly crafted, classic comic book masterpieces.\n\n&quot;All of these books are essential purchases for comics fans... These are the books that best show off how EC took genre stories seriously, striving to create comics that didn't treat readers as naive or ignorant.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Los Angeles Times\n\n&quot;...I am not only appreciative...but also very impressed. [The books] are spectacular packages of their featured artist and their stories.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Al Feldstein\n\nShould you ever feel like buying one of Fantagraphics super awesome books (and almost all of them are, imo), please visit their website http://www.fantagraphics.com/ (the 20/20 Club is a great deal), or ask your LCS guy to point you in the right direction (or get on the ball and order some stuff!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b085981a0d656bdc1b9fcffcaceff9aad1ddb43a","amp;dn":"George+Evans+-+Aces+High+%28The+EC+Comics+Library%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b085981a0d656bdc1b9fcffcaceff9aad1ddb43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,133,152,26,13,101,107,220,27,159,207,252,172,239,249,170,209,221,180,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
