Will the world end with a whimper or a bang?\n\nW.H. Mumfrey covers it all.

Essential topics include foraging for food, looting 101, barricades and fortifications for beginners, dealing with cannibals, mutant identification, post-apocalyptic fashions, renovating your subterranean hideout, decoys and booby-traps for dummies, dating after doomsday and more.\n\nSo as you stockpile your bottles of water, dig out your bunker, and finesse your plan for a brand new government, keep this book in hand. You won't be sorry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc808554c8d8f1c85101e524b56f2707fbb11187","amp;dn":"The+Official+Underground+2012+Doomsday+S+-+W.+H.+Mumfrey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc808554c8d8f1c85101e524b56f2707fbb11187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,128,133,84,200,216,241,200,81,1,229,36,181,111,39,7,251,177,17,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
