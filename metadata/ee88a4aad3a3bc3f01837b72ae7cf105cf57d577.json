Harland\n\n\nThis book tells the story of Apollo 11 and dispels the myth that NASA faked the moon landings. The story is brought to life by exploiting the flight plan, mission report, in-flight transcripts (including conversations among the crew in the spacecraft that were not transmitted) and post-flight debriefing. It features scans recently produced by NASA of the original Hasselblad film. The final chapters discuss what was learned of the moon rocks, and reviews the follow-on missions. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive expertise and knowledge of the Moon landings shines through and seamlessly unites the myriad details of the mission.\n\n2007\nPDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee88a4aad3a3bc3f01837b72ae7cf105cf57d577","amp;dn":"The+First+Men+on+the+Moon%3A+The+Story+of+Apollo+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee88a4aad3a3bc3f01837b72ae7cf105cf57d577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,136,164,170,211,163,188,63,1,131,123,114,174,124,241,5,207,87,213,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
