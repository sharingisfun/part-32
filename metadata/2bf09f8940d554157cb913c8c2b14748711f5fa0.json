And, after sealing the deal on a dinosaur egg, they set their sights on a 20-foot totem pole. Later, while Sheldon eats oysters by the dozen, Scott combs through a fishermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s barn in search of maritime artifacts. Down the road, a seasoned picker opens up his mega man cave. Packed with jukeboxes, pinball machines, and vintage petroliana, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filled to the gills with awesome retro collectibles. At the northern tip of the island, Sheldon rides the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest eggbeater and the guys get a VIP tour of a folk artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funky studio.\n\n\nThere was no airing of this show last week.(Oct. 14)\nThere will be a new show airing next week.
