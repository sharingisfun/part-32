He always loved jam sessions, but it did not take too much insight to realize that putting trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and altoist Sonny Stitt together with a strong rhythm section would result in some explosive music. The fireworks really fly on this LP during versions of &quot;Tour De Force,&quot; &quot;Dizzy Meets Sonny,&quot; &quot;Mean to Me&quot; and &quot;Blues for Bird,&quot; with time out taken for a ballad medley. Bebop at its best.
