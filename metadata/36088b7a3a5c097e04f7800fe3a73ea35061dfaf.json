However, the barbed wire and infantries are not positioned to keep an enemy out, but to protect the rest of the world from a vampire plague that's spread over every inch of the country. Most of the living have fled the U.S., but a group of scientists remain behind, working on a cure. Now that they've succeeded, a military operation is launched from the President's current offices in the U.S. Embassy in London, to save the cure from the encroaching undead-but the real motivations of the military remain in question. \n\nWritten by Andrew Cosby with artwork from Jason Shawn Alexander. \n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36088b7a3a5c097e04f7800fe3a73ea35061dfaf","amp;dn":"Damn+Nation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36088b7a3a5c097e04f7800fe3a73ea35061dfaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,8,139,122,58,92,9,126,4,247,128,15,227,167,62,163,80,97,223,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
