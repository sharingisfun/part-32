They started out more thrash, but this disc is definitely Death, though a more experimental and musically accomplished breed than is the norm.\n\n This album kicks ass. Period, and I found it hard to believe it came out almost five years ago and didn't make more of a splash. Agressor start with a riffy, Celtic Frost style and layer it over with some keys, some strings, and a screaming Hell of ferocious death metal vocals that put David Vincent to shame. There are even some horn blasts here and there, just to keep you guessing. The album opener and title cut is a sprawling, six-minute-plus workout of atmosphere, savage vocals, and heavy, brass-balled riffing. There are no bad songs on this disc at all, though a lot of them are shorter than I would like. &quot;(I Am The) Spirit of Evil&quot; is a killer tune, but it's only 2 minutes long. Other short tunes are instrumental, like &quot;On Dolinde&quot; and the weirdly-named &quot;The Woodguy and the Black Beast&quot;. The rest of this thing just won't stop killing: &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;God From the Sky&quot;, &quot;Tribal Dance&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all murderous cuts of metal mayhem. &quot;Welcome Home&quot; is a cover of the King Diamond song off &quot;Them&quot;, and even though the vocals here are harsh, it comes off surprisingly well.\n So for some Morbid Angel-styled Death Metal with a kick of Thrash mixed in for good measure, this is a killer disc.\n\n Tracklist\n Medieval Rites\n Bloodshed\n The Woodguy and the Black Beast\n The Sorcerer\n (I Am The) Spirit of Evil\n Wandering Soul\n Tye-Melane Melda\n God From the Sky\n Welcome Home\n On Dolinde\n Burial Desecration\n Tribal Dance\n At Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4e47a7eeffee645ba6d5f1c6728658bde8a23d","amp;dn":"Agressor+-Medieval+Rites","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d4e47a7eeffee645ba6d5f1c6728658bde8a23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,78,71,167,238,255,238,100,91,166,213,241,198,114,134,88,189,232,162,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
