Batman]\nBy: Sam Keith\nIssues #1 - 5 [Complete]\n\n'A young werewolf stalks the DC Univese.'\n\nThis one is hard to describe and quite rare. This follows a young man/werewolf on \na surreal adventure. The story is very bizarre but interesting. The artwork is\nbeautiful and you should read it, if for no other reason than that alone. Batman does\nmake a brief appearance but its more a gimmick to sell the book than an actual Batman\nadventure. Chek it out.\n\n\nEnjoy and Please SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ddd353070651bc29579a8cd347c538cbe48c9d","amp;dn":"SCRATCH+-+DC+Comics+%5BFeat.+Batman%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ddd353070651bc29579a8cd347c538cbe48c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,221,211,83,7,6,81,188,41,87,154,140,211,71,197,56,203,228,140,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
