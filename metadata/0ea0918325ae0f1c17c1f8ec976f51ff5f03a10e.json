English subtitles. \n\n'Valley of the Wolves: Iraq,' the most expensive Turkish movie ever made. The plot is a cross between &quot;American Psycho&quot; in uniform and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. U.S. soldiers in Iraq pillage, murder and maim at will.\n\nThe movie follows a Turkish intelligence agent as he seeks to avenge the officers and restore their honor. This wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be so bad if the film didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t portray the opponents of Turks and Muslims so brutally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ- the bad guys in this black and white world are the Americans, the Kurds, the Christians and the Jews.\n\nThe movie portrays the Kurds of northern Iraq as puppets of the Americans and as a motley crew of dirty, cowardly soldiers with the exception of one soldier who (what else?) sides with the Turks. The AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ atrocities include attacking a wedding and killing the groom as well as a child Ã¢â‚¬â€œ- in front of its mother of course Ã¢â‚¬â€œ- before relishing in the torture of any survivors. The doctor who peddles organs is a Jew who selects his victims as if in a concentration camp before readying their organs for export to the US and Israel. Another traditionally dressed Jew(in northern Iraq o_O) leaves the area at the first sign of danger.\n\nThe film makes Christians and Jews appear as repugnant, conspiratorial holy warriors hoping to use blood-drenched swords to expand or reclaim the empire of their god. Islam, naturally, is depicted as the opposite Ã¢â‚¬â€œ- a religion of peace and mercy. \n\n As crazy as the plot sounds, similarly gory story lines constantly appear as 'news' in the Turkish and Arab media. The Middle East is awash with strange conspiracy theories, usually centering on some American-Zionist plot to subdue the Muslims while committing the most horrific hate crimes against peaceful Muslims.\n\n\nWhen asked about the factual nature of the scenario, BÃƒÂ¼lent ArÃ„Â±nÃƒÂ§, the chairman of the Turkish Parliament, replied 'yes, this was exactly as it happened&quot;. He called the movie &quot;an extraordinary film that will go into history'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ea0918325ae0f1c17c1f8ec976f51ff5f03a10e","amp;dn":"Valley+of+the+Wolves+Iraq+%5Bvile+Turkish+anti-American%2FWestern+mo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ea0918325ae0f1c17c1f8ec976f51ff5f03a10e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,160,145,131,37,174,15,28,23,193,248,236,151,111,81,255,95,3,161,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
