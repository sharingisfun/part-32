As illness threatens her life she lives life \nto the full and when she most fears death she learns to seize the day. \n-- De Telegraaf\n\n\n\n Sophie is twenty-one when she is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. \nA striking, fun-loving student, her world is reduced overnight to the \nsterile confines of a hospital. But within these walls Sophie discovers \na whole new world of white coats, gossiping nurses, and sexy doctors; \nof shared rooms, hair loss, and eyebrow pencils. \nAs wigs become a crucial part of Sophie's new life, she reclaims a sense \nof self-expression. Each of Sophie's nine wigs makes her feel different, \ngives her a different personality, and that is why each has its own name: \nStella, Sue, Daisy, Blondie, Platina, Oema, Pam, Lydia, and BebÃƒÂ©. There's \na bit of Sophie in all of them, and they reveal as much as they hide. \nSophie's voice is refreshingly candid and with a keen eye for the absurd, \nshe makes you smile when you least expect it. Above all, this is the story \nof a girl who is determined to be much more than a cancer patient.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:676a4e2b44f241a139c152390b64032c654cc811","amp;dn":"The.Girl.with.Nine.Wigs.2013.MULTiSUBS.PAL.DVDR-DiSHON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"676a4e2b44f241a139c152390b64032c654cc811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,106,78,43,68,242,65,161,57,193,82,57,11,100,3,44,101,76,200,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
