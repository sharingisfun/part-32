Joyland is a whodunit noir crime novel and a haunting ghost story set in the world of an amusement park.\n\nIt tells the story of the summer in which college student Devin Jones comes to work as a 'carny' in small-town North Carolina and has to confront the legacy of a vicious murder, the fate of a dying child, and the way both will change his life forever. It is also a wonderful coming-of-age novel about friendship, loss, and your first heartbreak. Who dares enter the funhouse of fear ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd071322974cda134b8d676f81d9fd7f2897b2f","amp;dn":"Joyland+-+Stephen+King.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd071322974cda134b8d676f81d9fd7f2897b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,208,113,50,41,116,205,161,52,184,214,118,248,29,159,215,242,137,123,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
