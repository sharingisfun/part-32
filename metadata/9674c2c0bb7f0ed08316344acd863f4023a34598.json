These are the main points of the proposal for copyright reform that the Pirate Party is advocating and which the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament adopted as its group position in September 2011.

This booklet explains why such a reform is both necessary and sustainable and will benefit both citizens and artists.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6089/reformb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6089/reformb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9674c2c0bb7f0ed08316344acd863f4023a34598","amp;dn":"The+Case+for+Copyright+Reform+%5BPdf+Doc+Txt+Rtf+Epub+-+Eng%5D+TNT+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9674c2c0bb7f0ed08316344acd863f4023a34598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,116,194,192,187,127,14,208,131,22,52,74,205,134,63,64,35,163,69,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
