Players equip up to three gems to their characters, which provide different stat boosts depending on the type of gem. Six varieties of gems exist: attack, defense, speed, vitality, assist, and Cross Gauge. Each gem and its effects are designated by a specific color, and will activate as the players fulfill certain conditions during battle. When a character on a player's team has less than 25% health remaining, that character can be sacrificed in order to activate Pandora Mode, which gives the remaining fighter increased strength and an infinite Cross Gauge. However, this state has a time limit and the player automatically loses if he/she cannot defeat the opponent before the Pandora state runs out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86240215b4598e77bfb858bac95a41b008f8d327","amp;dn":"Street+Fighter+X+Tekken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86240215b4598e77bfb858bac95a41b008f8d327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,36,2,21,180,89,142,119,191,184,88,186,201,90,65,176,8,248,211,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
