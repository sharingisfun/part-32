With Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, by Bruce A. Tate, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, Seven Languages hits whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages.\n\nFor each language, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the languageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most important features. As the book proceeds, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quicklyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them.\n\nAmong this group of seven, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure.\n\nExplore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use ErlangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.\n\nAbout the Author\nBruce Tate runs RapidRed, an Austin, TX-based practice that consults on lightweight development in Ruby. Previously he worked at IBM in roles ranging from a database systems programmer to Java consultant. He left IBM to work for several startups in roles ranging from Client Solutions Director to CTO. He speaks internationally and is the author of more than ten books, including From Java to Ruby, Deploying Rails Applications, the best-selling Bitter series, Beyond Java, and the Jolt-winning Better, Faster, Lighter Java.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 300 pages\nPublisher: Pragmatic Bookshelf (October 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 193435659X\nISBN-13: 978-1934356593","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ed7ff6cb1399c0201f4ceb908938087a806d7b","amp;dn":"Pragmatic.Seven.Languages.in.Seven.Weeks.Oct.2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ed7ff6cb1399c0201f4ceb908938087a806d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,237,127,246,203,19,153,192,32,31,76,235,144,137,56,8,122,128,109,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
