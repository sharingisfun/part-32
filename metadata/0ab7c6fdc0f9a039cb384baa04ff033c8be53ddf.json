The album sees URIAH HEEP \n\nback to their very best and is set to become a future classic, sure \n\nto please their dedicated worldwide fan base and fans of progressive \n\nrock in general.\nIn the words of Mick Box, &quot;We are delighted to be reunited with a \n\nmajor label in Universal music&quot;.\n\n&amp;#039;Wake The Sleeper&amp;#039; is an album we are incredibly proud of, and one \n\nthat we hope the fans will see as one of URIAH HEEP&amp;#039;s best. We can&amp;#039;t \n\nwait to get back out on the road to showcase the new songs.\n\nThe live arena has been vital to the longevity of URIAH HEEP.\n\nThis is the band&amp;#039;s first album without their long-standing and \n\noriginal drummer Lee Kerslake who sadly had to leave the band due to \n\nill health in January 2007.
