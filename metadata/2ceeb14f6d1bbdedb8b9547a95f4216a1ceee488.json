Is it really hanging,\nor maybe it's just downloading a large e-mail attachment? DU\nMeter provides the answer to these and other mysteries, and can\nalso alert you of dangerous or unexpected network activity.\nWatching your data transfer rates can be very enlightening no\nmatter what you do online, and you'll soon be wondering how you\nmanaged without DU Meter before.\n\n\nDU Meter for parents and business managers\nÃ‚Â· Receive alerts about dangerous or unexpected network activity\n\nIf you have teenage children or if you own or manage a small\nbusiness, you already know how hard it is to enforce certain\nrules for network usage, while respecting child's or employee's\nprivacy.\n\nIf you install DU Meter on your child's or employee's computer,\nyou can configure it to report back to you via email when monthly\nor weekly network traffic exceeds a certain threshold. DU Meter\nwill let you know if someone is breaking your rules (For example\nusing peer-to-peer software to share films and music). Since DU\nMeter 5, the software can even prevent any further Internet\nconnectivity once the alert condition has been met, without any\nuser intervention.\n\nRemember, you are legally responsible for what your kids are\ndoing online. And while sharing music or videos may seem benign\nto them, copyright holding companies are suing peer-to-peer\nnetwork users for thousands of dollars for copyright violations.\nDU Meter can alert you in time, so this kind of activity can be\nprevented.\n\n\nIs your Ã¢â‚¬Å“unlimitedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Internet really unlimited?\nÃ‚Â· Protect yourself from unexpected charges or Internet service\ndisruption\n\nMany Internet users believe their &quot;unlimited&quot; account lets them\nsurf the Internet, send large email attachments and download as\nmany movies and songs as they choose. However it is well\ndocumented by the media that many Internet Service Providers,\nboth in the U.S. and elsewhere, do in fact set definite usage\nlimits, even though they may advertise to the contrary. Some will\ntake drastic measures like termination of an account without any\nadvance warning, if these limits are exceeded. DU Meter can\ncreate detailed reports of the total network traffic volume on\nyour computer and can alert you if certain limits are surpassed.\nIf you have teenage children or if you own or manage a business,\nDU Meter can be especially useful for you to you too.\n\n\nDU Meter 6.0 new features:\n\nMost important new features in DU Meter 6.0\nÃ‚Â· Full compatibility with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.\nÃ‚Â· Taskbar integration mode is fully rewritten.

Just hover your mouse over DU\nMeter taskbar band.\nÃ‚Â· Totals and reports updating can be suspended automatically,\nbased on the currently connected Wi-Fi network. Useful if your\nlaptop's bandwidth usage caps are only applicable to one\nlocation.\nÃ‚Â· Optional reporting to dumeter.net:\nÃ‚Â· If you have several computers, dumeter.net lets you see their\ncombined bandwidth usage: clear and simple charts display daily\ntrends, hourly averages and other important metrics. Detailed\ndaily, hourly and monthly reports are available, and can be\nsaved and printed easily.
