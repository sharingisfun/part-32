(32 kbps / 22 kHz Mono,Fraunhofer CBR).\n\nThis great novel is written in an autobiographical style and tells the story of Jane Eyre, who was orphaned at an early age and taken in by her uncle, Mr. Reed, who shortly also died, leaving her in the care of her cruel Aunt, Mrs. Reed, and at the mercy of her malicious cousin, John Reed. However, at the age of ten Jane Eyre leaves the Reed household to attent a charity boarding school known as Lowood where she befriends the mild mannered Helen Burns and gains the education that allows her, at the age of eighteen, to take a position as a Governess at Thornfield Hall. Here she meets the 'dark and sardonic' Mr. Rochester and falls in love with him. But alas, their union is not to be when Jane discovers a dark secret of Mr. Rochester's that forces her to leave Thornfield Hall and her chance of happiness as a married woman.\n\n\n* I have uploaded another copy of Jane Eyre here narrated by Susan Ericksen, but I find her slight American accent distracting in this classictale. Amanda Root's narration is perfect.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2e090ac19f86730444746e53dd5dbb40ad0f992","amp;dn":"Jane+Eyre+-+Charlotte+Bronte++%28Unabridged+-+Naxos%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2e090ac19f86730444746e53dd5dbb40ad0f992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,224,144,172,25,248,103,48,68,71,70,229,61,213,219,180,10,208,249,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
