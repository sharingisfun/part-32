Great strides had been made in understanding the geometry of objects fixed in time and space. The race was on to discover the mathematics to describe objects in motion. This programme explores the work of Rene Descartes, Pierre Fermat, Isaac Newton, Leonard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss.\n\nTech Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1650 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 58 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 740 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-T\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa7be376501f593d08a83c0da391121fdf08009","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Story+of+Maths+3of4+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa7be376501f593d08a83c0da391121fdf08009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,167,190,55,101,1,245,147,208,138,131,192,218,57,17,33,253,240,128,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
