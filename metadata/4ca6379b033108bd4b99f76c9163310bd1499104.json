BUT NOT JUST ANY HALO. NOOOOO. This game I have here has been cracked and is portable. take it on a portable hard drives or delete some maps you don't like and try to fit it on a flash drive and it will run from any PC!\n\n2) This folder contains many custom maps that I have downloaded from www.halomaps.org. I do not own any of the maps and I take no credit for them. The game contains both multiplayer and single player maps. The User Interface map file has also been replaced by me (the replacement being from Halomaps.org as well) with one that is compatible with Campaign mode maps.\n\n3) This version has mods in it and doesn't need cracking or updates.\nThe mods are that Halo universal Aimbot is included, just open that program AFTER you open Halo (I trust everyone knows alt+tab switches between windows? or Windows+tab for the fancy way to switch~). AllDEV is included for those that want to use Halo CE's Console in-game. you may have to try a few times to start the game, as it sometimes crashes upon loading the first few times that you start it, but it will eventually stabilize.
