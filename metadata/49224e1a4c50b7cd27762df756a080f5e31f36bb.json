Parallels with the nineteenth- and twentieth-century discourse on poverty and justice and the contemporary discourse of risk and responsibility allow the author to reflect not only on the generation of knowledge through discourse but also on the role that sociology itself plays in this process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49224e1a4c50b7cd27762df756a080f5e31f36bb","amp;dn":"Discourse+and+Knowledge+The+Making+of+Enlightenment+Sociology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49224e1a4c50b7cd27762df756a080f5e31f36bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,34,78,26,76,80,183,205,39,118,45,247,86,160,128,245,227,31,54,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
