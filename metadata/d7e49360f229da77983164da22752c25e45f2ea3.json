Thus, a repress ordered by Ertegan at Atlantic.\n\nBarcode and Other Identifiers\n\n Matrix / Runout (Run-out area A-side, Etching): T ST-A-691671\n Matrix / Runout (Run-out area B-side, Etching): T ST-A-691672\n Label Code (Center Label A-side): (ST-A-691671 CTH)\n Label Code (Center Label B-side): (ST-A-691672 CTH)\n Matrix / Runout (Runout Area A and B Side): RL SS\n\nVinyl Ripping Process/Equipment\n\nVPI 16.5 RCM\n Turntable: VPI Scoutmaster\n Tonearm: Trans-Fi Termninator\n Cartridge: Audio-Technica AT33PTG/II\n Phone Stage: Cinemag SUT feeding a Marantz 2220B\n Digital Interface: E-MU 1212\n Recording Software: Adobe Audition 3.01\n Recording Bitrate/Sample Rate: 192/24\n\nPost Processing\n Run thru ClickRepair at level 10 with\n Pitch Protection | off\n Reverse | on\n Simple\n Resample to 96khz in Izotope Rx2 using the default preset\n Manually listen to album in Adobe Audition cleaning any clicks/anomalies\n Flac with Xrecode II\n\nWhat Exactly Is An &quot;Ultimate Master&quot;\n\n It is more or less a catchphrase originally used to designate something was a hi-res rip. But since there seems to be a lot &quot;similarly&quot; &lt;cough&gt; named rips now I guess I should explain.\n\n I try to present the &quot;ultimate mastering&quot; of a particular LP, the &quot;mastering&quot; is not my equipment or process but the source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is &quot;definitive&quot; is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e49360f229da77983164da22752c25e45f2ea3","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Led+Zeppelin+-+II+-+1969%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e49360f229da77983164da22752c25e45f2ea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,228,147,96,242,41,218,119,152,49,100,218,34,117,44,37,228,95,46,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
