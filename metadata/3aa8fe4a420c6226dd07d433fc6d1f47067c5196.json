With their king captured by the English, Scottish nobles plot to ransom James behind the back of the brutal regent holding their land in his iron grip. But not every clan wishes to see King James back on his throneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSitting atop this powder keg of bloodthirsty rivalries, Malcolm of clan MacKintosh takes the mysterious, lone maiden he finds along his road as a bad omenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦though an undeniably beautiful one. When he attempts to save her from a rogue within his own garrison, she deftly brings Malcolm to his knees. Who is this willful lass who has so quickly laid siege to his heart?\n\nAlethia Goodsky has met all kinds working at the New York Renaissance Festival, but no one like the fortune-teller who tasks her with a cryptic life-saving mission and flings her into the fifteenth century. Now Alethia must rely on her wits to unravel the mystery in this violent land. Malcolm has sworn to protect her, but her gifts may soon make her his protector. With enemies closing in, Alethia must choose between finding a way homeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and remaining true to her Highlander.\n\nCover: http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1380948137l/18482683.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa8fe4a420c6226dd07d433fc6d1f47067c5196","amp;dn":"Barbara+Longley+-+True+to+the+Highlander+%28Loch+Moigh+%231%29+%5BEPUB%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa8fe4a420c6226dd07d433fc6d1f47067c5196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,168,254,74,66,12,98,38,221,7,212,51,252,109,31,71,6,124,81,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
