When Constantine teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister, their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.\n\nBasic Information:\nFilm Length: 2h:04m\nLanguage: English\nEncoded By: Isis\nOriginal Source: Retail DVD\n\nVideo Information:\nFormat: AVI\nVideo Bitrate: 1225 Kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 4:3\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.148\nCodec: XviD\nResolution: 720x480\n\nAudio Information:\nFormat: AC3\nAudio #1: 448kb/s 48000 Hz 6-channel\n\nIsis NOTES\nPC, PS3 &amp; XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE\nThese releases have 6-channel audio.
