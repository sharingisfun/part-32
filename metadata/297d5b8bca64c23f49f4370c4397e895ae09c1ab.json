Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) in his office during his later years. He asks that a writer (Ed Westwick) be let in, so that he may tell the story of the origin of the FBI for the sake of the public. Hoover explains that the story begins in 1919, when A. Mitchell Palmer was Attorney General and Hoover's boss at the Justice Department. Palmer suffers an assassination attempt, but is unharmed when the bomb explodes earlier than intended. Hoover recalls that the police handling of the crime scene was primitive, and that it was that night that he recognized the importance of criminal science. Later, Hoover visits his mother (Judi Dench), and tells her that Palmer has put him in charge of a new anti-radical division, and that he has already begun compiling a list of suspected radicals. He leaves to meet Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts), who has just started as a secretary at the Justice Department. Hoover takes Gandy to the Library of Congress, and shows her the card catalog system he devised. He muses about how easy it would be to solve crimes if every citizen were as easily identifiable as the books in the library.\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: J Edgar 2011 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2393.69 MiB\nDuration: 2h 16mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 445 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2012-02-23 07:11:10\nSubtitles: English,Romanian\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 120 r2164 da19765\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x536\nSource: SPARKS Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/21325056461561418041.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/21325056461561418041.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/22344501815943535735.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/22344501815943535735.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/44361007035550185878.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/44361007035550185878.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/37677734377613155700.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/37677734377613155700.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: 297D5B8BCA64C23F49F4370C4397E895AE09C1AB\n\n:::     :::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::\n:+:     :+:    :+:   :+:    :+::+:       \n+:+     +:+    +:+   +:+       +:+       \n+#+     +:+    +#+   +#+       +#++:++#  \n +#+   +#+     +#+   +#+       +#+       \n  #+#+#+#      #+#   #+#    #+##+#       \n    ###    ################### ##########","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:297d5b8bca64c23f49f4370c4397e895ae09c1ab","amp;dn":"J+Edgar+2011+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"297d5b8bca64c23f49f4370c4397e895ae09c1ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,125,91,139,202,100,194,63,73,244,55,12,67,151,232,149,174,9,193,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
