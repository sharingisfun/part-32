They were originally established with American rock band Elf's members, but Blackmore fired all the members except Ronnie James Dio who would leave in 1979. Three British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neoclassical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide and 4 million albums in the United States.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStraight Between the Eyes is the sixth studio album by the British hard rock band Rainbow, released in 1982. A remastered CD reissue, with packaging duplicating the original vinyl release, was released in May 1999.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRainbow:\n\n\nRitchie Blackmore: guitar (Fender Strat, Marshall)\n\nRoger Glover: bass (Hondo Longhorn 4 &amp; 8 string), producer\n\nJoe Lynn Turner: vocals (Shure Microphones)\n\nBobby Rondinelli: drums (Yamaha, Sonor &amp; Paiste)\n\nDavid Rosenthal: keyboards (Oberheim, Moog, Roland, Hammond &amp; Hohner), orchestral arrangements\n\n\nAdditional Musicians:\n\n\nFrancois Dompierre: orchestra conductor\n\nRaymond Dessaint: orchestra lead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc7764b34f72e7b84bbc04e7bef3ba6c52027ce","amp;dn":"Rainbow%2FStraight+Between+The+Eyes+%5B1982%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BJPNSHM%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc7764b34f72e7b84bbc04e7bef3ba6c52027ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,199,118,75,52,247,46,123,132,187,192,78,123,239,59,166,197,32,39,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
