But if you want to be cynical you can describe the play as telling the story of 'democratic liberators joining up with a cannibal to overthrow those who represent the brutal idiocy of modern civilisation.'\r\n\r\nThere are three superior recorded versions of The Tempest and this is one of them. (the others are Redgrave on Caedmon and McKellen on Naxos) This would have been recorded from ABC fm in 1975, as originally first broadcast by the BBC in Dec.1974. Paul Scofield, supported by a fine cast, is in the main role. Listen to Scofield delivering Prospero's set-piece speeches from the last Act of the play. This is the way to speak Shakespearian verse. The sound is excellent and not far from CD quality (originally recorded on high quality equipment by a relative) Kindly seed .\r\n\r\n(the original audio had only mp3 sound. This has lossless flacs)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f979bd944e1ae94177c0368d8d6d37c2a7cc60e7","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+3+-+Tempest+-+Scofield+-+bbc+1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f979bd944e1ae94177c0368d8d6d37c2a7cc60e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,121,189,148,78,26,233,65,119,192,54,141,141,109,55,194,167,204,96,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
