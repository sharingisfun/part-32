It was also my hopes that dividing \nthese books into chapters will make it easier for people to keep track of \ntheir place, and for them to be better able to decide when they've reached \na good stopping point if they have to take a break from reading.  \n\n\nI plan to have more audio books uploaded in the near future.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1058aca0eb49524ce4278001fe9e7a0dd044305","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+%284%29+And+The+Goblet+Of+Fire+%28Chapters%29+-+56kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1058aca0eb49524ce4278001fe9e7a0dd044305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,5,138,202,14,180,149,36,206,66,120,0,31,233,231,160,221,4,67,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
