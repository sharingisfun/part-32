The Bonzos were a Dada inspired musical \ncomedy group, which rose to fame in the sixties and is still loved by legions \nof music fans today. the Bonzos blended music, comedy, vaudeville and \nsurrealism all tinged with eccentric reflections of twenties, the Edwardian \nworld and the last echoes from cool Britannia&amp;#039;s days of empire.\n\nThe year 2006 marks the 40th anniversary of the release of &amp;#039;My Brother Makes\nThe Noises For the Talkies&amp;#039;, the first record by The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band.\n\nOn January 28th 2006 The Astoria theatre in London hosted a very special\nevening celebrating the music and achievments of the legendary Bonzo Dog Doo\nDah Band. For this unique occasion Musical Director Neil Innes was joined live\non stage by former band mates Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear, &amp;#039;Legs&amp;#039; Larry \nSmith, Sam Spoons, Vernon Dudley Bohay Nowell, Bob Kerr and red hot house\norchestra featuring Tom Fry, JJ Jones, Andy Roberts and Mickey Simmonds.\n\nThe part of the late great and sorely missed Vivian Stanshall was performed\nvariously by Messrs Stephen Fry, Adrian Edmondson, Phill Jupitus and Paul\nMerton.\n\nFor the first time since the group broke up in the early seventies a British\nstage once again resounded to the inspired flights of lunacy of the Bonzos\nfavourites performed live and the world was suddenly a sunnier place.\n\n\n\n                               TRACK LIST: \n\n    * Rule Britannia\n    * My Brother Makes The Noises For The Talkies\n    * Little Sir Echo \n    * Falling In Love Again\n    * Watermelon\n    * Music from The Leg (Whispering)\n    * Sheik of Araby\n    * Hello Mabel\n    * Jolity Farm\n    * The Equestrian Statue\n    * We Are Normal\n    * The Strain\n    * The Sound Of Music\n    * Exodus\n    * The Trouser Press\n    * My Pink Half Of The Drainpipe\n    * I&amp;#039;m Bored\n    * Sport (The Odd Boy)\n    * Mr Apollo\n    * Look At Me\n    * I&amp;#039;m Wonderful\n    * San Francisco\n    * Rhinocratic Oaths\n    * Mr Slater&amp;#039;s Parrot\n    * Monster Mash\n    * Urban Spaceman\n    * Canyons Of Your Mind\n    * The Intro and Outro\n    * Slush\n\n\n                                TECHNICAL:\n\n  Run Time:          89 min. \n  Color:             Color\n  Format:            NTSC\n  Type:              DVD-5\n  Subtitles:         none\n  Region:            Region 0\n  Volume name:       BONZO_DOG\n  Aspect Ratio:      16:9\n  Studio:            Classic Rock Legends\n  DVD Release Date:  22 May 2006 \n\n                               SHARE &amp; ENJOY\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f89f9d8d621cfe5ab9d89e0250014a639aa98ea4","amp;dn":"Bonzo+Dog+Doo-Dah+Band+40th+Anniversary+%282006%29+NTSC+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f89f9d8d621cfe5ab9d89e0250014a639aa98ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,159,157,141,98,28,254,90,185,216,158,2,80,1,74,99,154,169,142,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
