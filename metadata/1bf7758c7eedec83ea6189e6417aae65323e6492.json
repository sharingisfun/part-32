The prices to buy per season are quite excellent and if they&amp;#039;re as good as dvd rips I&amp;#039;ll be purchasing (and removing the DRM) to them. Really it&amp;#039;s worth it.\n\n2) Time Warner sucks ass. Yeah they finally added many of the new HD channels in my area they FAILED to add the Travel channel. Fuck you time warner.\n\n3) Yeah I can&amp;#039;t count. I feel I should let everyone know regardless of the number of caps done on this series... I&amp;#039;ve yet to watch past the first five or so episodes? Yes... I haven&amp;#039;t even watched season 2 and onward. That is all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf7758c7eedec83ea6189e6417aae65323e6492","amp;dn":"Anthony.Bourdain.No.Reservations.S04E08.Romania%5Bcabra%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf7758c7eedec83ea6189e6417aae65323e6492","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,247,117,140,126,237,236,131,234,97,137,230,65,122,174,101,50,62,100,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
