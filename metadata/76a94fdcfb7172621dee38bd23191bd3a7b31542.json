The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, &quot;It's a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!&quot;\n\nBook 2: Zom-B Underground (Zom-B #2) by Darren Shan (January 2nd 2013)\n\nWaking up in a military complex, months after zombies attacked school, B has no memory of the last few months. Life in the UK has turned tough since the outbreak, and B is woven into life- and battle- in the new military regime quickly. But as B learns more about the zombies held in the complex and the scientists keeping them captive, unease settles in. Why exactly was B saved? And is there anyone left in the world to trust?\n\nBook 3: Zom-B City (Zom-B #3) by Darren Shan (March 14th 2013)\n\nHow many survived the zombie apocalypse?Where do the living hide in a city of the dead?\n\nWho controls the streets of London?\n\nB Smith is setting out to explore...\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76a94fdcfb7172621dee38bd23191bd3a7b31542","amp;dn":"Zom-B+Series+%281-3%29+by+Darren+Shan+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76a94fdcfb7172621dee38bd23191bd3a7b31542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,169,79,220,251,113,114,98,29,238,56,189,35,25,27,211,167,179,21,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
