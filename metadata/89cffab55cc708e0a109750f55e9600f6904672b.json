If you like her, please buy her cds when you have money, she's awesome and deserves all the recognition we can give her.\n\nOn another note, she also has two other albums, Monarcana and Macy's Day Bird / Black With Green Leaves, which I don't have, and two really good collaborations with Jeffrey Lewis, which I do have.  Comment a request if you want me to add the Jeffrey Lewis songs to this torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89cffab55cc708e0a109750f55e9600f6904672b","amp;dn":"Diane+Cluck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89cffab55cc708e0a109750f55e9600f6904672b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,207,250,181,92,199,8,224,161,9,117,15,85,233,96,15,105,4,103,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
