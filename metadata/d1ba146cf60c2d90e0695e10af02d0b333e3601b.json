Features an online high scoreboard that allow you to compare your skills against other players from around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal in Maze Unsafe Mine is to get past a level before the timer runs out and try to get as many points as you can. This version has ten levels each getting harder as you go. Remember to get the lights then it is much easier to find your way. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou can control the game 2 ways. 1. Using the keyboard (W,S,A,D) keys and the mouse. 2. Uses a XBox 360 controller just by plugging it in to your U.S.B. port.\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1ba146cf60c2d90e0695e10af02d0b333e3601b","amp;dn":"Maze+v2.0.1+for+Windows+%5BFULL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1ba146cf60c2d90e0695e10af02d0b333e3601b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,186,20,108,246,12,45,144,224,105,94,16,175,2,208,179,51,227,96,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
