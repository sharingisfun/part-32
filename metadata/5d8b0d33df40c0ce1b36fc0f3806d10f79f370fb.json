In what Professor Clare R. Kinney calls the &quot;power and audacity of his poetry and stagecraft,&quot; Shakespeare has left audiences breathless these past four centuries. His artistry is as evident in moments of insensate rage, as when King Lear dares Nature to do her worstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n    Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!\n    You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\n    Till you have drenched our steeples,\n    drowned the cocks! \n\nas it is in moments of heartbreaking tenderness, as when Othello steals a few last kisses from the sleeping and innocent wife he is about to murder for the adultery he imaginesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n    Ah balmy breath, that doth almost persuade\n    Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nBut beyond his astonishing feats of language and dramatic impact, Shakespeare also left us a legacy, crafted from his experiences and explorations, of suffering and transgression in his six great mature tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus.\n\n Course Lecture Titles\n\n1.\tDefining Tragedy\n2.\tShakespearean Tragedy in Context\n3.\tHamlet IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Stand and unfold yourself&quot;\n4.\tHamlet IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Performance of Revenge\n5.\tHamlet IIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Difficult Women\n6.\tHamlet IVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Uncontainable Hamlet\n7.\tOthello IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Miscegenation and Mixed Messages\n8.\tOthello IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Monstrous Births\n9.\tOthello IIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Ocular Proof&quot;\n10.\tOthello IVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Tragic Knowledge\n11.\tKing Lear IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Kingship and Kinship\n12.\tKing Lear IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Unaccommodated Man&quot;\n13.\tKing Lear IIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Stage of Fools\n14.\tKing Lear IVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Is this the promised end?&quot;\n15.\tMacbeth IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Desire and Equivocation\n16.\tMacbeth IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Dispute it like a man&quot;\n17.\tMacbeth IIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bloody Babes and Bloody Ends\n18.\tAntony and Cleopatra IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Epic Desires\n19.\tAntony and Cleopatra IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Identity Politics\n20.\tAntony and Cleopatra IIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Art of Dying\n21.\tCoriolanus IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Loner and the Mob\n22.\tCoriolanus IIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Theater of Politics\n23.\tCoriolanus IIIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mothers and Killers\n24.\tConclusionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Beyond Tragedy?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d8b0d33df40c0ce1b36fc0f3806d10f79f370fb","amp;dn":"TTC+Shakespeare%5C%27s+Tragedies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d8b0d33df40c0ce1b36fc0f3806d10f79f370fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,139,13,51,223,64,192,206,27,54,252,15,56,6,209,15,121,243,112,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
