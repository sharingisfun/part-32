It is Tootie's official sequel to his preceding Cleveland 20's &amp; 30's Meetup Greatest Hits (...or not) compilation release. The compilation mostly features songs well-known to the Cleveland 20's &amp; 30's Meetup Group, songs heard during meetups of the group that occurred before production started, as well as the theme for the then-upcoming Adult Prom Night.\n\nThe compilation is completely sourced from lossless material. All of the compilations' songs utilize playback gain values from Tootie's personal volume-leveling procedure, resulting in a consistent overall listening experience without the need to adjust the volume between songs.\n\n\n    The Black Eyed Peas - I Gotta Feeling\n    Daft Punk - Around the World\n    009 Sound System - Dreamscape\n    Darude - Sandstorm\n    Far East Movement - Like a G6\n    The Lonely Island - Jizz in My Pants\n    Miss Kittin - 1000 Dreams\n    Lady Gaga - Monster (Tootie Uncensored Remaster)\n    The Big Tymers - Get Your Roll On\n    Ginuwine - Pony\n    Britney Spears - 3\n    Prince - Let's Go Crazy\n    Buckcherry - Crazy Bitch\n    Green JellÃƒÂ¿ - Three Little Pigs\n    Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit\n    Aerosmith - Love in an Elevator\n    Twisted Sister - We're Not Gonna Take It\n    Republica - Ready to Go\n    AC/DC - Thunderstruck\n    Journey - Don't Stop Believin'\n    Joe 'Bean' Esposito - You're the Best Around\n    Bryan Adams - I Do It For You\n    Incubus - Drive\n\nDetails:\nFormat: FLAC (24-bit)\nLength: Precisely 1 hour, 40 minutes\nAverage bitrate: 1,603 kbps\nEmbedded CUE Sheet\n\nPlayback verified with foobar2000.\n\n\nNotes:\nThe audio quality gain from mixing to 24-bits over 16-bits is fairly marginal. However, it restores some of the definition lost from mixing to 16-bits, especially on tracks that were mastered very loud.\nThe use of the tracks in the compilation independently is not recommended as most tracks are intermixed in some way. Many are shortened.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0f8bc403b5f3b9626636f41c5d9303c34aa6a8","amp;dn":"Cleveland+20%27s+30%27s+Greatest+Hits+II%3A+Do+Something+Crazy%21+%2824-bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0f8bc403b5f3b9626636f41c5d9303c34aa6a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,15,139,196,3,181,243,185,98,102,54,244,28,93,147,3,195,74,166,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
