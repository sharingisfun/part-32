Where Nocturne was crafted largely in Barthmus' bedroom, this time he had a string quartet record arrangements based on chopped-up samples of classical music in one studio, a live band record in another studio, and enlisted the help of David Wrench to give it all a harmonious mix. The results are more streamlined than Sun Airway's debut, but just as vivid; Barthmus was inspired by fittingly elaborate imagery like Versailles' gilded glass halls and the work of the Japanese art collective NAM - whose Soft Fall artwork captures the album's elegant chaos - and the elliptical word paintings of Andre Breton's poetry. While this is a remarkably process-oriented album, Soft Fall is also some of Barthmus' most engaging work, especially on the tracks where tight song structures give form and contrast to his grandiose tendencies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3935ae78bd85157e6449cad2e32b313ca2e6c68d","amp;dn":"Sun+Airway+-+Soft+Fall+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3935ae78bd85157e6449cad2e32b313ca2e6c68d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,53,174,120,189,133,21,126,100,73,202,210,227,43,49,60,162,230,198,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
