Martyn was 19 when he recorded his first album, &quot;London Conversation,&quot; and working in the acoustic folk style of the period. As he progresses, he moves to electric guitar, his work moves to a heavier beat and begins to reflect the blues, jazz and reggae influences that would color his work in the second half of his career. A popular and highly respected artist in Europe, Martyn never caught on in the United States, despite the boosts Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and others tried to give his career. Drink and drugs plagued him until his death, at age 60, in 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f1e8aac3af554a589e9926a94c7b83e6af3b230","amp;dn":"John+Martyn+-+Back+Down+My+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f1e8aac3af554a589e9926a94c7b83e6af3b230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,30,138,172,58,245,84,165,137,233,146,106,148,199,184,62,106,243,178,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
