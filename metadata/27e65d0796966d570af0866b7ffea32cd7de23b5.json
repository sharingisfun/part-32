It started as a music newspaper, and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 90s, changing from newsprint in 1998. It was the first British paper to include a singles chart, in 14 November 1952 edition. In the 1970s it became the best-selling British music newspaper. During the period 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism (self-involved reporting), then became closely associated with punk rock through the writing of Tony Parsons.\n\nAn online version of NME, NME.com, was launched in 1996. It is now the world's biggest standalone music site, with over 7 million users per month. As of 16 August 2012, the magazine's circulation was measured as 23,924 (declining).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e65d0796966d570af0866b7ffea32cd7de23b5","amp;dn":"NME+Special+Collectors%27+Magazine+Blur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e65d0796966d570af0866b7ffea32cd7de23b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,230,93,7,150,150,109,87,10,240,134,107,127,254,163,44,215,222,35,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
