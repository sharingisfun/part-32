If we consider the full range of human potential as the spectrum of the rainbow, then each individual is unique and has the potential to develop all of the intelligences using different areas of the brain. The author has included several lesson plans that can be adapted for students of any age, and has written them to meet U.S. and California standards. This book will be a valuable resource for educators and administrators, school boards, and parents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1208dc0708a2ecfaa32f238da4ccd3377831def","amp;dn":"Rainbows+of+Intelligence+-+Teele%2C+Sue+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1208dc0708a2ecfaa32f238da4ccd3377831def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,32,141,192,112,138,46,207,170,50,242,56,218,76,205,51,119,131,29,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
