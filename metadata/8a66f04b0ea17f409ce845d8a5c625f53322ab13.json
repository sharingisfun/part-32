The graphics in games are\nso important that they often can make or break a gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s success. It is true\nthat all other aspects of a game are important, but the visuals are at times\nthe main selling point along with game play, brand recognition, and so\nforth. This has been true for a long time in the games industry, where 3D\ngames have been known for their visuals.\n\nIn this book, we will examine many graphical techniques that are used\nin the games industry to create cutting-edge, modern applications. The\ngraphics used in games are real-time computer graphics. This means a lot of\nthe information discussed in this book also applies to other graphicalrelated\nindustries that use either real-time or non-real-time graphics, but\nour focus will be primarily on video games. Since this book focuses on\ngame graphics, we will examine many different real-time techniques as\nwell as some non-real-time techniques that can be preprocessed and used\nin games, which is very common in video games today.\n\nBy the time you reach the end of this book, you will have a firm understanding\nof many of the more popular effects and techniques used in\nmodern video games and how to implement them. This book discusses a\nlot of theory and makes heavy use of both pseudo code and illustrations\nto help make it easier for you to learn the information regardless of what\nprogramming language, graphical tools, and so on you choose to use.\nThere will also be C++ code samples throughout this book, but the information\nprovided is generally not specific to any one language or tool.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a66f04b0ea17f409ce845d8a5c625f53322ab13","amp;dn":"Game+Graphics+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a66f04b0ea17f409ce845d8a5c625f53322ab13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,102,240,75,14,161,127,64,156,232,69,216,165,198,37,245,51,34,171,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
