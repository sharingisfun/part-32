In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d11ce4ed21ee81eb3691c59b85cad1bc35417490","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Ndega+Zvangu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d11ce4ed21ee81eb3691c59b85cad1bc35417490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,28,228,237,33,238,129,235,54,145,197,155,133,202,209,188,53,65,116,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
