Peter tries to reunite the dolphin with his ex-wife in hopes that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll return to the ocean, but his plan backfires and the whole dolphin family moves into ClevelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old house.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:928ff9b1d15a7cc6100335ada48954fed980fd59","amp;dn":"Family.Guy.S10E14.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION+%5BOFO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"928ff9b1d15a7cc6100335ada48954fed980fd59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,143,249,177,209,90,124,198,16,3,53,173,164,137,84,254,217,128,253,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
