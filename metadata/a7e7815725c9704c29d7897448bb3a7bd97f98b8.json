During her visit to Australia, Dines won supporters and made enemies with her hardcore railing against porn's excesses, economics, pervasiveness and effect on our lives.\n\n[b]Detailed Program Description[/b]\n\nIn her best-selling book &quot;Pornland&quot;, Gail Dines outline her arguments about how pornography has hijacked the sexuality of men, women and children ... including how boys are viewing it as young as 10, and how teenagers are using it as their only real sex education.\n\nHer work on media and pornography has appeared in academic journals, magazines, newspaper, radio and TV across the globe.\n\nDines' view is that pornography distorts the user's view of sexuality and makes more difficult the establishment of real-life intimate relationships with women. She argues modern pornography is cruel and violent, and has the effect of degrading the position of women in society generally. The prevalence of hardcore internet pornography, Dines argues, is a contributing factor in increasing &quot;demand&quot; for sex trafficking.\n\nDines shows how the hyper-sexualisation of culture and the ways pornographic images filter into mainstream pop culture. Her detractors point out that rape and misogyny pre-date hard-core internet porn by thousands of years. Therefore, how then is turning off the tap of internet porn going to solve the problem?\n\nThis presentation, at New South Wales Parliament House, was hosted by the anti-pornography group Collective Shout.\n\n[b]Gail Dines[/b] is professor of sociology and women's studies at Boston's Wheelock College. Her latest book is &quot;Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality&quot;. She is a recipient of the Myers Center Award for the Study of Human Rights and a founding member of Stop Porn Culture. Dines was born in Manchester, England and received her PhD from Salford University. She moved to Israel in 1980 at the age of 22, where she married and became a feminist, and then to the United States in 1986.\n\nFor more information on this episode, including information on the guests and various other resources and links, visit the episode webpage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/07/12/3266838.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/07/12/3266838.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\nNote:  This is a MP4 video podcast that is available for free download from the website.
