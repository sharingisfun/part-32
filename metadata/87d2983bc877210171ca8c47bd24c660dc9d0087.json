The significance of Islamic theology reflects the immense importance of Islam in the history of monotheism, to which it has brought a unique approach and style, and a range of solutions which are of abiding interest. Devoting especial attention to questions of rationality, scriptural fidelity, and the construction of 'orthodoxy', this volume introduces key Muslim theories of revelation, creation, ethics, scriptural interpretation, law, mysticism, and eschatology. Throughout the treatment is firmly set in the historical, social and political context in which Islam's distinctive understanding of God evolved. Despite its importance, Islamic theology has been neglected in recent scholarship, and this book provides a unique, scholarly but accessible introduction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d2983bc877210171ca8c47bd24c660dc9d0087","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Companion+to+Classical+Islamic+Theology+%5BENG%5D+%5BPDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d2983bc877210171ca8c47bd24c660dc9d0087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,210,152,59,200,119,33,1,113,202,140,71,189,36,198,96,220,157,0,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
