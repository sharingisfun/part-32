He has been a postdoctoral engineer in modeling and simulation at Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK, and a Fulbright postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. He received the AccÃƒÂ©sit Mapfre Award in 2003, the Outstanding Ph.D Award from the Universidad de Salamanca in 2008, and the P&amp;G Award for his contributions to modeling and simulation in 2009. His current research interests are in the modeling and optimization of renewable-based processes.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface....vii\nEditor ....ix\nContributors....xi\nList of Software.... xiii\nChapter 1 Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization in the Chemical Engineering Curriculum....1\nChapter 2 Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization in the Process and Commodities Industries..... 11\nChapter 3 ExcelÃ‚Â® for Chemical Engineering....23\nChapter 4 MATLABÃ‚Â® for Chemical Engineering.... 91\nChapter 5 PTC MathcadÃ‚Â® for Chemical Engineering..... 163\nChapter 6 Computational Fluid Dynamics and Multiphysics..... 195\nChapter 7 Discrete Element Method Applications in Process Engineering....245\nChapter 8 Modular Process Simulators....287\nChapter 9 Introduction to gPROMSÃ‚Â® for Chemical Engineering....367\nChapter 10 Algebraic Modeling and Optimization....455\nChapter 11 Use of GAMSÃ‚Â® for Optimal Process Synthesis and Operation....481\nChapter 12 AIMMSÃ‚Â® for Scheduling of Chemical Plants....511\nChapter 13 Plant Location: Supply Chain Management....529\nChapter 14 Dynamic Optimization in Process Systems....541","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34cd667c98c4142c8e847b8e85792b2c53f214bf","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Software+for+Chemical+Engineers+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34cd667c98c4142c8e847b8e85792b2c53f214bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,205,102,124,152,196,20,44,142,132,123,142,133,121,43,44,83,242,20,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
