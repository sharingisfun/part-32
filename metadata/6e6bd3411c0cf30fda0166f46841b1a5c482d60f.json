Not since Luke Skywalker first stepped aboard the Millennium Falcon has the galaxy seemed like such a vast, exciting, dangerous place! Readers will meet a host of new characters, see fleets of new spaceships, and visit scores of exotic locationsÃ¢â‚¬â€some new and some familiar. This is a perfect jumping-on point for any reader.\n\nCollects Legacy #1-3 and #5-6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e6bd3411c0cf30fda0166f46841b1a5c482d60f","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Legacy+v01+-+Broken+%282007%29+%28digital-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e6bd3411c0cf30fda0166f46841b1a5c482d60f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,107,211,65,28,12,243,15,218,1,102,244,104,65,177,165,196,130,214,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
