So I decided to\ngive her this &quot;Sound track&quot; featuring the titles Sonya has used in her\npieces throughout the series.\n\nPlease note that I simply searched the net for the titles included in this\n&quot;release&quot; so expect some random quality. I did, however, run them through\nMP3Gain to normalize the volume levels.\n    \ntrack list\ntrack                                                    length   episode air date\n01 Hot Chip - Wrestlers (Sticky Dirty Pop Mix)           05:26    s04e10  6/25/08\n02 Otis Redding - These Arms Of Mine                     02:31    s04e16  7/16/08\n03 Mirah - The Garden                                    02:21    s04e20  7/30/08\n04 The Ting Tings - Great DJ (Calvin Harris Remix)       07:06    s05e04  6/3/09\n05 Terry Poison - 24 Hours (Aston Shuffle A-Bomb Remix)  06:09    s05e08  6/17/09\n06 Blue Foundation - Eyes On Fire                        05:04    s05e12  7/1/09\n07 Css - Move (Metronomy Remix)                          03:45    s05e18  7/22/09\n08 True Romance - She Wants Revenge                      04:11    s05e20  7/29/09\n09 Nina Martine - Kick It (Stereoheroes Remix)           04:28    s05e20  7/29/09\n10 Mstrkrft - Heart Breaker (feat John Legend)           03:13    s05e22  8/5/09\n11 Audio Bullys - Shot You Down (feat Nancy Sinatra)     02:56    s05e23  8/6/09\n12 Platinum Pied Pipers - On A Cloud                     03:33    s06e10  10/26/09\n13 Arcadia - Apparat                                     05:10    s06e11  10/27/09\n14 Hot Chip - So Deep                                    02:36    s06e17  11/24/09\n15 Lykke Li - Time Flies                                 03:22    s06e17  11/24/09\n16 Oona and Dave Tweedie - Tore My Heart                 03:17    s06e19  12/1/09\n                                                         1:05:05\nMerry Christmas M!
