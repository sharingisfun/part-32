Included in this torrent is the program and a dump of all rcg frames as of 3/24/16. You can use these to make your own comics of arbitrary length, or to print out a deck of Joking Hazard cards. I've included back images, box art and instructions to facilitate this. There are currently 594 frames, which is more than the official game according to their Kickstarter. Barring any further changes to the system you should be able to use my program to update your deck whenever new frames are added to the rcg.\r\n\r\nHave fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970ffdd380917370f7b5e7e54c44f2f203ba27e2","amp;dn":"Cyanide+%26amp%3B+Happiness+RCG+Dump+%28Joking+Hazard%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970ffdd380917370f7b5e7e54c44f2f203ba27e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,15,253,211,128,145,115,112,247,181,231,229,76,68,242,242,3,186,39,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
