King's classic instrumental &quot;Hide Away&quot; would be a de facto standard for fledgling blues players for decades. An innovative instrumentalist and underrated singer, King would move beyond blues and soul to make commercial inroads into funk and even soul music. Along the way, he would influence string-benders like Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and George Thorogood, among others.\n\n\nTracklist\n1. (I'd Love To) Make Love To You 2:25\n2.
