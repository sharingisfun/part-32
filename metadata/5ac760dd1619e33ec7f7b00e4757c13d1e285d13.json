However, their 2004 release, Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice, marked a change to a vastly more technical, experimental, and well-recorded sound featuring such musical influences as Russian Orthodox chanting and choral music.\n\nThe band's work after Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice has been even more experimental and technical, with the 5 tracks they released in 2005 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on KÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ´se and a pair of splits (the material from the latter of which was later reissued as the Mass Grave Aesthetics and Diabolus Absconditus EPs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ totaling nearly eighty minutes in length and actually exceeding the length of Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice. The second volume of the band's trilogy, Fas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum, was released on July 16, 2007, outside the United States, and the following day within the United States, to considerable acclaim.[3][4] The band released another EP in January 2009, entitled Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum: Chaining the Katechon. The final album in the trilogy, Paracletus, was released by Norma Evangelium Diaboli and Season of Mist on November 9, 2010.[5] The band's final work related to the trilogy,[6] titled Drought, was released on June 22, 2012.\n\nVery little is known about the members of Deathspell Omega, as the band does not have an official website and does not release information about their membership. However, they have given interviews over the years that explain more about their beliefs and ideology.\n\n* Artist: Deathspell Omega\n* Album: Infernal Battles\n* Year: 2000\n* Style: Black Metal\n* Country: France\n* Format: APE: cue+image\n\nTracklist:\n1. &quot;The Victory of Impurity&quot;   5:02\n2. &quot;Drink the Devil's Blood&quot;   4:22\n3. &quot;Extinction of the Weak&quot;   5:27\n4. &quot;Sacrilegious Terror&quot;   4:56\n5. &quot;Raping Human Dignity&quot;   4:20\n6. &quot;The Ancient Presence Revealed&quot;   5:39\n7. &quot;Knowledge of the Ultimate Void&quot;   4:42\n8. &quot;Death's Reign (Human Futility)&quot;   4:20\nTotal length:\n38:48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac760dd1619e33ec7f7b00e4757c13d1e285d13","amp;dn":"Deathspell+Omega+-+Infernal+Battles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac760dd1619e33ec7f7b00e4757c13d1e285d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,199,96,221,22,25,227,62,199,247,176,14,71,87,193,61,30,40,93,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
