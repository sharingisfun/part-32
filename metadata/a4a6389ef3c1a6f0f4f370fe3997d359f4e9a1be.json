By edict of the Grand Inquisitor Mir Yannick, the Empire has been sealed off and the practice of mystic arts declared punishable by &quot;Totemization&quot; (a very bad thing). The only way to restore magic to the kingdom is to find three hidden artefacts: The Coconut of Quendor, The Cube of Foundation, and The Skull of Yoruk.\n\nJoin forces with Dungeon Master Dalboz who calls you &quot;AFGNCAAP&quot;( politically-correct initialism for &quot;Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person&quot;) and together you travel throughout the Underground Empire's many locations, such as Hades, Flood Control Dam #3 and The Dungeon Master's Lair in an attempt to find the three missing artefacts and bring about the fall of the Inquisition.\n\nZork: Grand Inquisitor is the last instalment of the famous Zork adventure series. It uses the same formula as its predecessor: first-person perspective, 360 degree camera rotation, pre-rendered backgrounds, and live actors. Humor and comical pop-culture references accompany you throughout the entire game and guarantee that you will never get bored. So if you are looking for a not so serious old-school adventure then this gem is for you.\n\nFeatures:\n    - Stunning graphics and enchanting music absorb you into over 30 unique 360^(0) environments\n    - Live action video and voice acting by stars such as Dirk Benedict, Michael McKean and David Landerr.\n    - Visit the famous landmarks that made Zork legendary.
