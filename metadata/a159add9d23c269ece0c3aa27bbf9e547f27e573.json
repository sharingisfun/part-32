Sumerian cuneiform tablets from 3000 BC show a poppy harvest, as do ancient Egyptian scripts and Greek statues adorned with poppy crowns. Far more recently, Freud sung the praises of cocaine, which was included in the original recipe for Coca-Cola. But since the industrial revolution, drug use has changed dramatically, and society's response to this--particularly in America--has been to demonize users and make drugs illegal.\n\nHOOKED explores the world of illegal drugs, meeting with pharmacologists and scientists to learn exactly what effect they have on us and exploring the social and legislative changes that have transformed (and, some would argue, created) the drug culture of the 20th century. Outspoken advocates on both sides of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; illuminate this polarizing issue, and fascinating accounts and artifacts illustrate the role of drugs throughout history. \n\nIn a series investigating the history of drug use, we begin our trip tracing the rise of marijuana and synthetic amphetamines. Marijuana, from the Indian hemp plant, has been used worldwide as a source of rope, cloth, and paper; its medicinal qualities were first documented 4,000 years ago in China. But it's best known as the drug of choice of the 1960s. During WWII, US troops were given an estimated 200 million amphetamines to fight drowsiness and battle fatigue, and they're still used to fight depression. \n\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n\nThanks to the peers all over the globe seeding in this collection\n\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a159add9d23c269ece0c3aa27bbf9e547f27e573","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+HC+-+Marijuana+-+Hooked+-+Illegal+Drugs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a159add9d23c269ece0c3aa27bbf9e547f27e573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,89,173,217,210,60,38,158,206,12,58,162,123,191,158,84,127,39,229,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
