Each chapter includes a compelling account of an assassination (or attempted assassination), with complete details about the assassin, the victim, the circumstances of the attack and the outcome. In the Crosshairs also includes a unique &quot;assassination timeline,&quot; a list of other notable assassination attempts throughout history, photos of many of the most infamous assassins and their victims, and rare archival materials, like the John Wilkes Booth &quot;Wanted&quot; poster and excerpts from original police reports. He also presents intriguing details like how President Anwar Sadat probably would have survived if he hadn't taken off his bulletproof vest-he didn't like the way it made his dress suit bulge. This surprising, informative, and intriguing book will find a place on every history buff's bookshelf.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58be98d4105f3fea50de240c97841e366393d2cc","amp;dn":"In+the+Crosshairs+-+Famous+Assassinations+and+Attempts+From+Juli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58be98d4105f3fea50de240c97841e366393d2cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,190,152,212,16,95,63,234,80,222,36,12,151,132,30,54,99,147,210,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
