Today oil is our only option of transportation fuel at the pump. Our exclusive use of it has drained our wallets, increased air pollution and sent our sons and daughters to war in faraway lands. PUMP shows us how through the use of a variety of replacement fuels, we will be able to fill up our carsÃ¢â‚¬â€cheaper, cleaner and American-madeÃ¢â‚¬â€and in the process, create more jobs for a stronger, healthier economy.\n\nDirector: Joshua Tickell, Rebecca Harrell Tickell\n\nWriters: Johnny O'Hara\n\nActors: John Hofmeister, Elon Musk, Luiz InÃƒÂ¡cio da Silva\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 28 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98e02386c4025aaafdd9c23189caccc7a6e32e55","amp;dn":"Pump.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98e02386c4025aaafdd9c23189caccc7a6e32e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,224,35,134,196,2,90,170,253,217,194,49,137,202,204,199,166,227,46,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
