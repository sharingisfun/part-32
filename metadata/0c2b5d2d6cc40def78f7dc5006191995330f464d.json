Maxwell has invested in this academically respectable 220-minute historical pageant. In adapting Jeffrey Shaara&amp;#039;s 1996 novel (encompassing events of 1861-63, specifically the Virginian battles of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville), Maxwell sacrifices depth for scope while focusing on the devoutly religious &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (Stephen Lang), whose Confederate campaigns endear him to Gen. Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall, giving the film&amp;#039;s most subtle performance). Battles are impeccably recreated using 7,500 Civil War re-enactors and sanitized PG-13 violence, their authenticity compromised by tasteful discretion and endless scenes of grandiloquent dialogue. Still, as the first part of a trilogy that ends with The Last Full Measure, this is a superbly crafted, instantly essential film for Civil War study. For all its misguided priorities, Gods and Generals is a noble effort, honoring faith and patriotism with the kind of reverence that has all but vanished from American film ? but provides abundant proof that historical accuracy is no guarantee of great storytelling.\n\nStudio: Warner Home Video \n\nDVD Release Date: July 15, 2003 \n\nRun Time: 229 minutes \n\nResolution: Widescreen, 576X320\n\nAudio: 128kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2b5d2d6cc40def78f7dc5006191995330f464d","amp;dn":"Gods+%26+Generals+%282003%29+DVDrip+DIVX+WS+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2b5d2d6cc40def78f7dc5006191995330f464d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,43,93,45,108,196,13,239,120,247,220,80,6,25,25,149,51,15,70,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
