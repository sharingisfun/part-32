Addressing challenges such as how to conceive a boy, the manuals offered suggestions such as tying a tourniquet around your husband's left testicle. Or should you want to goad female desires, throw 90 grubs in a liter of olive oil, let steep in the sun for a week and apply liberally on the male anatomy. Bell's journey through booklets long dismissed by scholars as being of little literary value gives us a refreshing and surprisingly fun social history.\n\n&quot;Lively and curious reading, particularly in its cascade of anecdote, offered in a breezy, cozy, journalistic style.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Lauro Martines, Times Literary Supplement\n\n&quot;[Bell's] fascinating book is a window on a lost world far nearer to our own than we might imagine. . . . How pleasant to read his delightful, informative and often hilarious book.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Kate Saunders, The Independent\n\n&quot;An extraordinary work which blends the learned with the frankly bizarre.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€The Economist\n\n&quot;Professor Bell has a sly sense of humor and an enviably strong stomach. . . . He wants to know how people actually behaved, not how the Church or philosophers or earnest humanists thought they should behave. I loved this book.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Christopher Stace, Daily Telegraph\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Guides-Renaissance-Italians/dp/0226042006/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373682847&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+do+it+renaissance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Guides-Renaissance-Italians/dp/0226042006/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373682847&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+to+do+it+renaissance&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75aca30e7ced69e5efaeb9d3c18398c06b38749","amp;dn":"How+to+Do+It%3A+Guides+to+Good+Living+for+Renaissance+Italians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75aca30e7ced69e5efaeb9d3c18398c06b38749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,90,202,48,231,206,214,158,94,250,235,157,60,24,57,140,6,179,135,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
