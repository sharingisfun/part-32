Patrick McGoohan\n\nMarch 19, 1928 - January 13, 2009\n\nThe Prisoner: Six Into One - The Prisoner File (1984)\n\n\nFrom IMDB\n\nThis half-hour documentary was screened by Channel 4 following a repeat of the final 'Prisoner' episode ( 'Fall Out' ) in 1984, and has never been rerun by the station or made available on D.V.D. This is strange, seeing how it features interviews with many of the people responsible for the show, such as producer David Tomblin, directors Don Chaffey and Pat Jackson, set designer Jack Shampan, actor Alexis Kanner, script editor George Markstein, and, surprisingly, Patrick McGoohan himself. The filmed interviews were linked by actor Saul Reichlin, occupying a 'Green Dome' style control room. No attempt was made to analyse the series in depth or interpret its hidden meanings, instead the show's history was presented in a straightforward fashion. Particularly interesting was Markstein's assertion that 'No.6' was always intended to be 'John Drake' of 'Danger Man' fame, despite McGoohan's frequent denials. The man himself was, as you'd expect, non-committal, cheekily signing off with...\n\n'Be Seeing You!'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b1cdfcb92d441f9858f13f16c1a49514fe6dad","amp;dn":"The+Prisoner+-+Six+Into+One+-+The+Prisoner+File+%28+1984+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b1cdfcb92d441f9858f13f16c1a49514fe6dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,177,205,252,185,45,68,31,152,88,241,63,22,193,164,149,20,254,109,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
