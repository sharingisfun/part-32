To millions of Americans, it is a holiday in name only. To a departed generation, it was a poignant reminder of the suffering and loss of innocence brought by World War I. On that day in 1918, the &quot;&quot;Great War&quot;&quot; officially ended. The date and time were known in advance. So why did over 13,000 men die on that day?\n\nTHE LAST DAY OF WWI reveals how Allied leaders found outrageous excuses to send thousands of soldiers to their deaths against a defeated enemy. Some desired promotion, others craved retribution. Despite the human toll, nothing was gained--territories taken that day were eventually returned to Germany. The senseless 11th-hour slaughter captures WWI in a microcosm--pointless carnage for no positive purpose.\n\n\n\n\nFile size : 350 MB\nFormat : Audio Video Interleave\nPlayTime : 45mn 6s\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo \nCodec : XviD\nFamily : MPEG-4\nInfo : XviD project\nCodec settings : BVOP\nWidth : 640\nHeight : 480\nAspect ratio : 4/3\nFrame rate : 25 fps\n\nAudio \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFamily : MPEG-1\nCodec profile : Joint stereo\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nBit rate mode : CBR\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\nResolution : 16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ca0fd2c5b8d2f2f2175236a5b5fbaaed7f9416","amp;dn":"The+History+Channel-Last+Day+Of+WW1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7ca0fd2c5b8d2f2f2175236a5b5fbaaed7f9416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,202,15,210,197,184,210,242,242,23,82,54,165,181,251,170,237,127,148,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
