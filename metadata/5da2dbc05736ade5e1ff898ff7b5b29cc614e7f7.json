Paul Robeson stars as John Zinga, a British-born stevedore who is discovered by an influential impresario and becomes a singing star. His newfound wealth and prestige allow him to return to Africa and trace his lineage, whereupon he discovers he is the descendant of a tribal princess whose people have fallen under the corrupt rule of spiritualists.\n\nVideo: XVID 720x576 25.00fps 1184Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps\nRunning time: 1:13:22","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5da2dbc05736ade5e1ff898ff7b5b29cc614e7f7","amp;dn":"Song+of+Freedom+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5da2dbc05736ade5e1ff898ff7b5b29cc614e7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,162,219,192,87,54,173,229,225,255,137,143,247,181,178,156,198,20,231,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
