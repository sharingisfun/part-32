The band is composed of vocalist/guitarist Franklin James Fisher, bassist Ryan Mahan and guitarist Lee Tesche. Algiers pulls from a divergent number of musical (and nonmusical) influences; the most notable of which being post-punk, gospel music, Southern Gothic literature and the concept of the Other.[1] Their sound has been described as &quot;dystopian soul&quot;[4] due to its somber mood, afrofolk inspired vocal approach, and heavy emphasis on atonal textures.\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_(band)#Discography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96605ded85e2d5514b35c20fec5a8c2a41f65ba6","amp;dn":"Algiers+-+Algiers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96605ded85e2d5514b35c20fec5a8c2a41f65ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,96,93,237,133,226,213,81,75,53,194,15,236,90,140,42,65,246,91,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
