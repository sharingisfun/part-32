They have 30 years of service investigating murders, and before they pull the pin, they want to solve their last big case. The city has a serial killer who is targeting criminals who have fallen through the cracks of the judicial system and have gotten away with rape, murder, and other heinous crimes. The serial killer believes that he is helping the police by taking the scum of the earth out of society for good, never to hurt any law abiding citizens again. The serial killer shoots the criminal at very close-range and leaves a four-line poem justifying the execution. Turk and Rooster want to give this person a medal, but instead, they must arrest him before he kills again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f872cc419781fc698a846f3eb9797164eebd77","amp;dn":"Righteous.Kill.DVDRip.XviD-ARROW%C3%82%C2%A9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f872cc419781fc698a846f3eb9797164eebd77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,248,114,204,65,151,129,252,105,138,132,111,62,185,121,113,100,238,189,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
