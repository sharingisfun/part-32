It's boisterous, exciting and fun, and makes you immediately think how great it would be to see this energetic music hybrid performed live.\n\nWith a voice that makes you wonder how vaudeville would have been if Jimmy Durante was a street punk, front man Torr Skoog barrels his gravelly vocals through each song, while Zack Brines hammers on the piano in a decidedly manic fashion. This alone could carry these guys, but the saxophones and washboard are pure icing.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Intro/New Thing Nuthin'\n02.Shit Out Of Luck [Explicit]\n03.Waitin' To Leave\n04.Nuthin' To Lose\n05.Where Do We Go\n06.The Kids Will Have No Say\n07.La Chupacabra\n08.Drive All Night\n09.Iron Out The Irony\n10.Callin' To Let You Know\n11.All I've Lost\n12.Nailhead [Explicit]\n13.Another Year\n14.11 To 3\n15.Fight Song For Fuck-Ups [Explicit]\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7732899d09cb3d2d7500c5fd3da65f770b017821","amp;dn":"The+Kings+Of+Nuthin%5C%27+-+Fight+Songs+%282002%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7732899d09cb3d2d7500c5fd3da65f770b017821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,50,137,157,9,203,61,45,117,0,197,253,61,166,95,119,11,1,120,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
