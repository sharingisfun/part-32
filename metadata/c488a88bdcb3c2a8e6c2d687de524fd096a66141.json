To achieve this aim I've covered combat training from boot camp up to the level required of a Special Forces soldier. And then gone on to add a few tricks of my own. I've done a bit of soldiering (Northern Ireland, SAS deployments, Bush Wars in Africa, life as a merc) and been in my fair share of fire-fights. I've only been wounded twice and learnt from both occasions. I'm going to use my experience to teach you to play the game. I'm not going to teach you how to survive in snowy mountains for a month with only one tea-bag or how to kill a room fill of people with only a toothpick. There are plenty of books that do that already. This book will teach you how to fight and survive war in the 21st century from the tools of the trade, to avoiding getting shot or blown-up, from surviving an interrogation to defending a position. This is a book not for the faint hearted. But then neither is war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c488a88bdcb3c2a8e6c2d687de524fd096a66141","amp;dn":"SAS+Ultimate+Guide+to+Combat+%282012%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c488a88bdcb3c2a8e6c2d687de524fd096a66141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,136,168,139,220,179,194,168,230,194,214,135,222,82,79,208,150,166,97,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
