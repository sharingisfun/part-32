Some of these are well-known hits and others more obscure works, but all bear the distinct lyrical, melodic and rhythmic signature of Paul Simon, one of the great composers of popular song in the last 50 years. As Simon has said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI think of myself as a songwriter first, the recording artist and performer in me follow in the writerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s footsteps.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Simon brought his own unique perspective on the nuances of his catalog in the assemblage of Songwriter, a new anthology of his work handpicked and sequenced by the artist. The album includes an emotionally resonant rendition of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Sound of Silence,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from SimonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2011 concert at New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Webster Hall and Aretha FranklinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transcendent studio take on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBridge Over Trouble WaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and other selections from the artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s critically-acclaimed catalog of songs. Selecting the individual songs for Songwriter, from the hundreds heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s written and recorded, presented Paul Simon an opportunity to to reflect over the entirety of his career and showcase the individual songs best-exemplifying the high-points in his conversations with the muses, from his early work with Simon &amp; Garfunkel through to his ruminations on the eternal now echoing across 2011's So Beautiful or So What.\n\n&quot;I think of myself as a songwriter first.
