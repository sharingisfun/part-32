A psychiatrist Panchabutam (Delhi Ganesh), convinced that Thenali is impossible, refers him to rival shrink Kailash (Jayaram). The doctor takes an instant dislike to his new patient, while his wife (Devyani) and sister (Jyothika) take more of a liking to him than Kailash would like. Interesting Sri Lankan accent, though mostly wasted on an overdone film. Kamal overacts.
