Such grace is costly because it calls us to follow, and it is grace because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life. It is costly because it condemns sin, and grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly because it cost God the life of his Son: 'Ye were bought at a price', and what has cost God much cannot be cheap for us. Above all, it is grace because God did not reckon his Son too dear a price to pay for our life, but delivered him up for us. Costly grace is the Incarnation of God.'\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship \n\n\n\nWhat is a moral person to do in a time of savage immorality? That question tormented Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German clergyman of great distinction who actively opposed Hitler and the Nazis. His convictions cost him his life. The Nazis hanged him on April 9, 1945, less than a month before the end of the war. Bonhoeffer's last years, his participation in the German resistance and his moral struggle are dramatized in this film. More than just a biographical portrait, Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace sheds light on the little-known efforts of the German resistance. It brings to a wide audience the heroic rebellion of Bonhoeffer, a highly regarded Lutheran minister who could have kept his peace and saved his life on several occasions but instead paid the ultimate price for his beliefs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2591f3f9b2e51f3347ee3b14e29d57225048d0bf","amp;dn":"Bonhoeffer+-+Agent+of+Grace.+Grace+Costs+Your+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2591f3f9b2e51f3347ee3b14e29d57225048d0bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,145,243,249,178,229,31,51,71,238,59,20,226,157,87,34,80,72,208,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
