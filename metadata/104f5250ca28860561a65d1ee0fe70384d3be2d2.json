Kate Quilton looks at free range hens, and is surprised to learn that most chicks on British farms have their beaks trimmed at birth. In the Netherlands, she visits a new cutting-edge farm designed using the latest scientific advances in hen welfare. Plus, in Scotland, Matt Tebbutt makes a surprising discovery about the origins of haggis, and then faces the ordeal of delivering some unwelcome news to an unsuspecting audience.\r\n\r\n2)  Japan \r\nKate Quilton heads to Japan on the trail of tofu, wondering how green soy beans are turned into something so white and creamy. Jimmy Doherty investigates reports that supermarket ready meals have nearly doubled in size since the 1950s. He tracks down the ready meals of his childhood and discovers whether bigger plate sizes could also be causing people to eat more. Plus, in Wales, Matt Tebbutt looks into a new kind of milk, which it is claimed is easier to digest.\r\n\r\n3)  Ecuador \r\nJimmy Doherty visits Ecuador, the largest banana exporter in the world, to investigate claims that the fruit could one day be used in the fight against a number of viruses including HIV and influenza. Kate Quilton goes in search of a meat substitute that delivers its promise on the tastebuds, visiting the Netherlands where a product called `plant meat' has been developed by scientists. Plus, Matt Tebbutt visits one of Britain's largest crisp manufacturers to witness the high-tech machinery used to maintain standards of quality.\r\n\r\n4)  California \r\nKate Quilton visits California to investigate why almond butter is more expensive than other nutty spreads. Jimmy Doherty heads to Spain and Portugal to find out how wine is turned into fortified wine, and with help from an innovative farmer and a team of cage fighters, Matt Tebbutt learns why slicing onions makes people cry.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3f/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/69/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Food-Unwrapped-Series-7-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3223 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 544 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/r5wq8/food-unwrapped","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104f5250ca28860561a65d1ee0fe70384d3be2d2","amp;dn":"Food+Unwrapped+Series+7+4of4+California+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104f5250ca28860561a65d1ee0fe70384d3be2d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,79,82,80,202,40,134,5,97,166,93,30,224,254,112,56,77,59,226,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
