Because once her friends arrive it's going to be harder to do anything else with her\n14:44 - Goes for the kiss and she says no Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but is smiling, which meansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n14:55 - Second angle: close her eyes but not kiss her\n15:07 - Third angle: just a peck on the lips\n15:27 - Fourth angle: only one way to find out\n15:45 - Another angle: trying to marry her\n15:48 - Getting her friends permission is key so she doesn't feel like she's too easy\n16:19 - The best way to deal with her cockblocking friend, is to make the cockblock laugh\n16:49 - The disgusting angle\n17:26 - The kissing on the cheek technique\n17:39 - A few spots to increase my chance\n17:48 - Try what you want to try, using different angles\n18:01 - Change your reasoning to persuade her to do the same thing, but in a different way\n\nThere are going to be times when you approach a girl and she will reject your advances, but not in a way to tell you to go away. Instead, her rejection is a test to see how persistent you can be with your advance. The idea though is not to keep saying or doing the same thing over and over, rather you need to change your actions and the things you say so you can keep the interaction alive: you need to find different angles to complete the advance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce394d021960d3c84881ac49004fd2039742324","amp;dn":"Simple+Pickup%3A+Project+Go+-+Month+12+Video+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce394d021960d3c84881ac49004fd2039742324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,227,148,208,33,150,13,60,132,136,26,196,144,4,253,32,57,116,35,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
