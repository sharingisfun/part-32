Written by Matthew Broughton; Full-cast dramatisation starring Sean Pertwee as Oliver Reed, and Arthur Darvill as Keith Moon.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Oliver was an international movie star, and Keith was a rock n'roll legend, the drummer for rock band, The Who. Both were famous for their partying and boozing, as well as their undeniable talents. Mercurial and unpredictable, both men were at the top of their game - but the top can be a very lonely place.\n\nThen they met, on the film set of The Who's epic rock opera, Tommy. What followed was a revelation - in each other they found a true kindred spirit, their own shadow image.\n\nThis is a story of madness and mayhem, antics and adventures, but also of love and loss - the dangerous, dazzling brilliance of two unbridled spirits connecting, but then the huge pain when one of them dies prematurely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed9cca4a680df471df6f5b8b8ab8adc8ac2320f","amp;dn":"Matthew+Broughton+-+Burning+Both+Ends%3A+When+Oliver+Reed+Met+Keit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed9cca4a680df471df6f5b8b8ab8adc8ac2320f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,217,204,164,166,128,223,71,29,246,245,184,184,171,138,220,138,194,50,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
