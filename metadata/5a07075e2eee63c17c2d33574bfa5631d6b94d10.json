Never a band to rely on their previous efforts, IMMOLATION has continued album after album to refine and hone their unique style and sound, creating some of the darkest and most adventurous death metal the scene has ever heard. With such classic albums as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHere In AfterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFailures for GodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œClose To A World BelowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Metal Blade), as well as their more recent critically acclaimed releases, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnholy CultÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHarnessing RuinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHope and HorrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShadows In The LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Listenable/Century Media), the band has developed into one of the premier extreme acts of our time. \n\nLegends in the underground scene with over two decades under their belts, one of the most ferocious live bands out there, and now with a new album ready to drop in 2010,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ IMMOLATION does not look like they are letting up anytime soon! With the release of Majesty and Decay, their first for Nuclear Blast Records, IMMOLATION has not only once again surpassed their previous releases, but has also without a doubt created their strongest, best produced and most crushing album to date! If a band has ever gotten better with age, IMMOLATION is the finest example. Recorded at Millbrook Sound Studios with long time producer Paul Orofino, mixed and mastered by the talents of Zack Ohren (Castle Ultimate Studios), and with the stunning artwork of Par Olofsson to complete the package, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajesty and DecayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an instant classic! \n\nWith even a more violent militant edge, and some of the most disheartening musical landscapes the band has ever created, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajesty and DecayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ towers in size and scope, taking the listener to the darkest, bleakest depths that only IMMOLATION can provide. From some of the bands fastest moments recorded, to their most pounding unrelenting scores of depravation, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajesty and DecayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has enough diversity and dynamics to lay the most die-hard listener to waste! If any album can define death metal today in its most true and matured form, this is it! Experience IMMOLATION for yourself and revel in the Majesty and Decay!!!
