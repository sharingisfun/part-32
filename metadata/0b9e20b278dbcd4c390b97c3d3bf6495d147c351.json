Winner of the Freeplay Award for Best Game Writing! With hilarious dialogue, charming hand-drawn art and huge replay value, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect for seasoned adventurers and casual gamers alike.\n\nWhen fugitive magician Lucas MacGuffin bungles a museum robbery, he finds himself:\n\n    magically bound to an ancient amulet;\n    up against a city in full high-tech security lockdown; and\n    suddenly dealing with the worst body hair problems heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever had.\n\nAs a human, Lucas is agile and cunning. Wolf Lucas would rather smash anything in his way. Only by transforming between the two forms and cleverly utilising both sets of skills will he stand any chance of lifting his curse.\n\nAnd with the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful billionaire after his blood, a jaded Private Investigator on his (now-literal) tail and the rent long overdue, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need every ounce of ingenuity he manage.\n\nAlong the way heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to befriend a hilarious cast of characters, convince the city its most beloved citizen is a terrifying criminal mastermind, and hardest of all, teach his daughter it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t funny to fill the fridge with dog food.\n\nFrom the award-winning indie developers behind Jolly Rover (Australian Game of the Year, 2010 Freeplay Awards), MacGuffinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Curse is a story brimming with humour, personality and heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Friendly for all players Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Enjoy a quick, fun logic puzzle fix, or lose yourself in a sprawling full-length cartoon adventure.\n    150+ Puzzle Rooms Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Inspired by classic top-down console adventures, these increasingly mind-bending challenges will push your logical thinking skills to the limit!\n    Challenge Without Frustration Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stuck on a room?
