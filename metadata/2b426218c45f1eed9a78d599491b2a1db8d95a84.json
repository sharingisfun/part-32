Now, in what may be his most \nsuspenseful and heartfelt, novel ever, he brings us the story of an ordinary \nman whose extraordinary commitment to his wife will take him on a harrowing \njourney of adventure, sacrifice, and redemption to the mystery of love \nitself?and to a showdown with the darkness that would destroy it forever.\n\nThe Husband\n\nWhat would you do for love? Would you die? Would you kill?\n\nWe have your wife. You can get her back for two million cash. Landscaper \nMitchell Rafferty thinks it must be some kind of joke. He was in the middle of \nplanting impatiens in the yard of one of his clients when his cell phone rang. \nNow he&amp;#039;s standing in a normal suburban neighborhood on a bright summer \nday, having a phone conversation out of his darkest nightmare.\n\nFrom its tense opening to its shattering climax, The Husband is a thriller that \nwill hold you in its relentless grip for every twist, every shock, every \nrevelation...until it lets you go, unmistakably changed. This is a Dean Koontz \nnovel, after all. And there&amp;#039;s no other experience quite like it.\n\n----\n\nDean Koontz, the author of many #1 New York Times bestsellers, lives with \nhis wife, Gerda, and their dog, Trixie, in southern California.\n\n----\n\nHolter Graham has recorded numerous audiobooks, and is a stage, television, \nand screen actor. His film credits include Fly Away Home, Maximum \nOverdrive, and Hairspray, and on TV he has appeared on Law &amp; Order and \nNew York Undercover.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b426218c45f1eed9a78d599491b2a1db8d95a84","amp;dn":"Dean+Koontz+-+The+Husband","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b426218c45f1eed9a78d599491b2a1db8d95a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,66,98,24,196,95,30,237,154,120,213,153,73,27,42,29,184,217,90,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
