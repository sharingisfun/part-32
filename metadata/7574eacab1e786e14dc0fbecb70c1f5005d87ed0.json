Packed to the gills with thrills, spills and chills, plus a lot of laughs and a little romance, Toy Story 3 is the family favourite that has it all!\n\nThe creative minds behind Disney/Pixar's groundbreaking animated blockbusters invite you back inside the toy box for a heartwarming and hilarious movie experience you'll never forget. In Toy Story 3, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) and the rest of the Toy Story gang return for an all-new adventure, along with a few new faces - some plastic, some plush - including Barbie's counterpart Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton), a thespian hedgehog named Mr. Pricklepants (voiced by Timothy Dalton) and a strawberry-scented bear named Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty).\n\nAs Andy prepares to depart for college, Woody, Buzz, Jessie and the rest of Andy's faithful toys wonder what will become of them. But, when a mix-up lands them at Sunnyside Daycare, they meet a host of new toys and soon discover a wild new adventure is just beginning. Buzzing with hours of bonus features, including the Pixar short film Day &amp; Night, Toy Story 3 goes to infinity and beyond!\n\nToy Story 3 2010 720p BDRip x264 -mp4+subs]by winker@kidzcorner&amp;1337x\\toystory3.mp4\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\n\nFile size : 2.65 GiB\nDuration : 1h 43mn\nOverall bit rate : 3 684 Kbps\n\n\n\n\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 43mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 3 045 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 25.9 Mbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\n\nCodec ID : ac-3\nDuration : 1h 43mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 640 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\n\nbig thanks to greyshadow[torrentforce],blackjesus,hec the hoose&amp;guyz@1337x for having the patience to teach an old dog new tricks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7574eacab1e786e14dc0fbecb70c1f5005d87ed0","amp;dn":"Toy+Story+3+2010+720p+BDRip+x264+-mp4%2Bsubs%5Dby+winker%40kidzcorner%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7574eacab1e786e14dc0fbecb70c1f5005d87ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,116,234,202,177,231,134,225,77,192,251,236,183,12,31,80,5,216,126,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
