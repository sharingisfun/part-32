Unlike Gary Brooker, producers Godley And Creme could exploit the slick, synth-based sound that Jupp was beginning to mine. However, the highly produced sound doesn't mesh with Jupp's main strength -- direct, simple rock &amp; roll. Instead of being powered by a driving beat, &quot;Switchboard Susan&quot; winds up sinking in the layers of keyboards and processed guitars. Yet the production does manage to save slight songs like &quot;You Made a Fool out of Me,&quot; creating an album of pleasant pop/rock that never manges to really sink in.\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mickeyjupp.se/cd.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mickeyjupp.se/cd.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
