These efforts benefit every field in which illustrations - thanks to their ability to clarify, emphasize, and convey very precise meanings - offer advantages over photographs. These fields include medicine, architecture, entertainment, education, geography, publishing, and visualization. &quot;Non-Photorealistic Computer Graphics&quot; is the first and only resource to examine non-photorealistic efforts in depth, providing detailed accounts of the major algorithms, as well as the background information and implementation advice readers need to make headway with these increasingly important techniques.\n\nPublished by Morgan Kaufman, an imprint of El$evier.\n\nRIP library dot nu, RIP ifile dot it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84fcab4ec098234993f03ec1ae1d3e5c106497a5","amp;dn":"Non-Photorealistic+Computer+Graphics+-+Strothotte+-+Schlectweg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84fcab4ec098234993f03ec1ae1d3e5c106497a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,252,171,78,192,152,35,73,147,240,62,193,174,29,62,92,16,100,151,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
