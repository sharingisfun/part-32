The most cunning and skilled of these pilots is Porco Rosso. A former Ace, he now makes a living flying contract jobs, such as rescuing those kidnapped by air pirates. Donald Curtis, Porco's rival in the air and in catching the affections of women, provides a constant challenge to the hero, culminating in a hilarious, action packed finale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c389df3f25d7e24780b1bbcbbb1927188008a9","amp;dn":"Porco+Rosso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c389df3f25d7e24780b1bbcbbb1927188008a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,195,137,223,63,37,215,226,71,128,177,187,203,187,25,39,24,128,8,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
