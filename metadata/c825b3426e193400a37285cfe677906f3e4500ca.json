A nine-track, 50-minute mixtape made available for free download on the Weeknd website, House of Balloons was based in morose ballads filled with drug references and sexual longing. Sonically, there were clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&amp;B ÃƒÂ  la Trey Songz, Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake, while appealing to listeners who favored left-of-center, production-over-songcraft exponents like Spacek and Sa-Ra. The mixtape, made by Tesfaye in collaboration with producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo, among others, garnered widespread coverage -- most of which was gushingly positive -- within days of its March 21 release. \n\n  A second mixtape, Thursday (August 19), preceded several appearances on Drake's album Take Care. Echoes of Silence (December 21), the third Weeknd mixtape, followed just before the end of the year. The following June, &quot;Crew Love,&quot; off Take Care, reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. A few months later, he was featured on another charting single, Wiz Khalifa's &quot;Remember You.&quot; After signing to Universal Republic, the three Weeknd mixtapes were remastered and bundled with three new songs for Trilogy, issued in November 2012. The set debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. A year later, the Weeknd announced the release of his first proper studio album, Kiss Land, which was slated for release in September 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c825b3426e193400a37285cfe677906f3e4500ca","amp;dn":"The+Weeknd+-+Kiss+Land+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c825b3426e193400a37285cfe677906f3e4500ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,37,179,66,110,25,52,0,163,114,133,207,230,119,144,111,62,69,0,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
