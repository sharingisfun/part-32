Your Sweet And Shiny Eyes \r\n\r\nFirst show back after being on the road and I forgot how much I like \r\nhometown shows.  Picked up my seats at will call.  Everything was easy.\r\nDuring opening act The California Honeydrops I knew the sound was spot\r\non.  I also knew there was a loudmouth directly behind me. Luckily she\r\nwas behind me because she can be heard at at few points thinking she was \r\nconversing with Bonnie or hacking up a lung.  This was one of the best\r\nBonnie sets I have seen.  New setlist mixed with both new and old.  A few\r\nreal gems.  Band was tight and Bonnie was having fun.  Great sound and \r\nperformance.  Enjoy.  Need help with setlist.  It was either get it posted\r\nwithout a list today or wait a week until I got around to figuring it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust the basic taper requests here and please no vitriol: \r\nDon't be an ass by selling this or using it in a video that is sold \r\nDon't modify the info file \r\nDon't remaster and/or post on other sites that are not 100% free \r\nIf shared keep info file intact but create a second file with any changes \r\nDon't convert to lossy formats except for personal use \r\nDo support the artists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a3fac77aab1cb8244349e03adfd756f652df42d","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Raitt+2016-04-23+mk4+Oakland+flac16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a3fac77aab1cb8244349e03adfd756f652df42d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,63,172,119,170,177,203,130,68,52,158,3,173,253,117,111,101,45,244,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
