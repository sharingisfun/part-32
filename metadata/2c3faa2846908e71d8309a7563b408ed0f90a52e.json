Up to that point, apart from Elvis Presley -- who was in a class by himself -- few white rock &amp; rollers had even tried to make as bold a use of the LP as what we hear on this record. Orbison, his collaborator Joe Melson, and producer Fred Foster turned the singer's debut long-player into a huge canvas for a sound that combined rock &amp; roll's beat, Nashville's countrypolitan sound, and the singer's unique multi-octave range and operatic intensity into something unique in music. The single &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; may have been the most accessible and commercial side of this new sound, but the whole album was packed with great moments and different permutations of that sound: the powerful lead vocal and the Boots Randolph sax break on &quot;I'll Say It's My Fault&quot;; the haunting Orbison-Melson &quot;Come Back to Me (My Love),&quot; which was like a mini-movie script, a vest-pocket romantic melodrama sung with operatic depth and played to a light rock &amp; roll beat; Don Gibson's &quot;I'd Be a Legend in My Time,&quot; and &quot;I Can't Stop Loving You,&quot; both filled with larger-than-life musical attributes and emotions behind Orbison's extraordinary singing, Orbison treating the former almost like a Verdi aria while a sax solo, the Anita Kerr Singers, and a dense string section hold it in the realm of pop music; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; given the new Orbison treatment and sounding like a country-pop symphony. ~ Bruce Eder\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
