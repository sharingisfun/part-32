The new, story-driven campaign lets you taste the explosive mix of the jungle, Hueys and rock-n-roll in 1968. The US campaign focuses on a team of elite special ops soldiers, and each one of them has a personality. The unit includes Sergeant John Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny Armstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill Kirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the others they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops.\n\nThe North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North Vietnam territory is a difficult one they have no means of radio communication, no wheeled vehicles, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too far to make it there on foot. On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath engagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet offensive. Missions range from special operations (rescuing a shot-down pilot, escorting a reporter, etc.) to full scale battles.\n\nMen Of War: Vietnam (2011) - Reloaded\n\nGame Type: PC Game\n\nLanguage: English\n\nFile Size: 2.45GB\n\nReleased Year: 2011\n\nGenre: Strategy (Real-time / Tactical) / 3D\n\nFile Type: ISO\n\nPublisher: 1C Publishing EU\n\nDeveloper: 1C SoftClub\n\n[b]Key Features:-[/b]\n\n* There are two sides in every story, so two new story-driven campaigns attempt to show the war from both sides.\n\n* Breathtaking missions including an ambush on the Ho Chi Minh trail, a game of cat and mouse in the Mekong Delta, raids into Cambodia and Laos, bridge defense during the Tet offensive and more.\n\n* New weapons and units: M-16, T-54, M-113, Patton III, M-60, AK-47, M-14, RPG-2, M-72 LAW, RPK and many more.\n\n* Multiplayer mode ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ co-op for up to 4 players.\n\n[b]Game + Mission Info:-[/b]\n\n- The game features two story campaign, consisting of five missions.\n\n- The first player to manage a group of four characters: two Russian instructors, saboteurs - past the Second World sapper, demolition, and a young sniper sent to the territory of South Vietnam to the Viet Cong soldier training, and the two men well-trained North Vietnamese army - the driver and interpreter.
