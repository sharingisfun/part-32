This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nHuey Lewis And The News are in the countdown with their fifth top ten hit from the album &quot;Fore&quot; - &quot;Doing It All For My Baby.&quot;\n\nCasey remembers actor (and recording artist?) Lorne Greene.\n\nCasey counts down the top ten show-business moneymakers of 1986-1987 according to Forbes Magazine, and the man in third place has a song in the countdown.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;In chart history, what has been the most common last name of acts hitting number one?&quot; Casey says the last name is shared by Tex, Roger, Andy, Maurice, and Denice.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown that once checked into a hotel, and decided to play a practical joke on their tour manager which included 29 live chickens. Casey tells the story.\n\nOne song in the countdown is a remake of a song by Tommy James and the Shondells. It was originally on the chart four years before the artist who currently sings it was even born.\n\nThe woman who holds the record for most number one hits in the 80's (as of this countdown) has a song on the chart.\n\nWe hear details about the conspiracy theory that Beatle Paul McCartney was dead. Casey even plays a Beatles song backwards for us to hear.\n\n40:    Heaven Is A Place On Earth - Belinda Carlisle\n39:    Notorious - Loverboy\n38:    Doing It All For My Baby - Huey Lewis And The News        \n37/LDD: Only In My Dreams - Debbie Gibson         \n36:    Holiday - The Other Ones     \n35:    (I've Had) The Time Of My Life - Bill Medley And Jennifer Warnes    \nOBIT: Lorne Greene\n34:    I've Been In Love Before - Cutting Crew\n33:    Victim Of Love - Bryan Adams\n32:    Fake - Alexander O'Neal\n31:    Can't We Try - Dan Hill With Vonda Shepard\n30:    Brilliant Disguise - Bruce Springsteen\n29:    Something Real (Inside Me/Inside You) - Mr. Mister    \n28:    Don't Make Me Wait For Love - Kenny G With Lenny Williams\n27:    Touch Of Grey - Grateful Dead\n26:    Wipeout - The Fat Boys And The Beach Boys\n25:    La Bamba - Los Lobos\n24:    Where The Streets Have No Name - U2\n23:    I Just Can't Stop Loving You - Michael Jackson\n22:    In My Dreams - Reo Speedwagon\n21:    It's A Sin - The Pet Shop Boys\n20:    When Smokey Sings - ABC\n19:    You Are The Girl - The Cars\n18:    Breakout - Swing Out Sister\nLDD: Always Something There To Remind Me - Naked Eyes\n17:    Mony Mony - Billy Idol\n16:    Little Lies - Fleetwood Mac\n15:    I Think We're Alone Now - Tiffany\n14:    One Heartbeat - Smokey Robinson\n13:    Jump Start - Natalie Cole\n12:    Let Me Be The One - Expose\n11:    Causing A Commotion - Madonna\n10:    Casanova - Lavert\n9:    Paper In Fire - John Cougar Mellencamp\n8:    Bad - Michael Jackson    \n7:    Who Will You Run Too - Heart\n6/LDD: Didn't We Almost Have It All - Whitney Houston\n5:    U Got The Look - Prince    \n4:    I Heard A Rumor - Bananarama\n3:    Carrie - Europe\n2:    Lost In Emotion - Lisa Lisa And Cult Jam\n1:    Here I Go Again - Whitesnake\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ec7e8c4acc7426575c16cb71246a440c5479e5","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1987_October_10th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ec7e8c4acc7426575c16cb71246a440c5479e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,236,126,140,74,204,116,38,87,92,22,203,113,36,106,68,12,84,121,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
