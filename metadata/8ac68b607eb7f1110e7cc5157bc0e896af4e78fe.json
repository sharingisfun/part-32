Set in the 1940s in Occupied Paris with haunting similarities to the world today, this is a novel that reminds us that sometimes only fiction can really tell us the truthÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. The story of one womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s courage in the face of racism, betrayal and hypocrisy on one hand and the veils of war on the other. It is also a love story between a Muslim and a Jew told in a language that resonates with mysticism and romance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ yet it is brutally honest in its assessment of motives and ambiguities.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Giller Prize Jury\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“BaldwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luminous prose captures the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention. . . . [She] immerses the reader in the atmosphere of the Vichy era, replete with undercurrents of terror and prejudice. . . . Readers, especially those interested in history and politics, will be intrigued by this gripping, richly textured novel penned by a consummate storyteller.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Winnipeg Free Press\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Baldwin has succeeded in crafting yet another indelible story based in fact.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Edmonton Journal\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Tiger Claw brilliantly reveals the shifting sands of allegiance in times of war and the duplicity required for survival when all who are operating underground are interdependent but no one can be trusted fully.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Gazette (Montreal)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Tiger Claw is a brilliant novel, a harrowing story of espionage and love, of loyalty and betrayal in the treacherous world of WWII Europe. Shauna Singh Baldwin has an astonishing ability to paint a very large canvas with amazing detail. You are there. Ã¢â‚¬ËœImpressiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hardly even begins to describe it: masterful. I could not put it down. A stunning achievement, but most of all, important.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Sandra Gulland\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A deeply felt, richly evocative novel that resurrects and reinvents a remarkable life, The Tiger Claw tells an affecting story of love and loss amidst the turbulence of war and human dislocation. It confirms Shauna Singh Baldwin as a major literary voice that transcends the borders that divide human experience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Shashi Tharoor\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Tiger Claw is a fascinating story of moral complexity, inner conflict and exile, a magnificent portrait of a very courageous woman, Noor Inayat Khan, the legendary French Resistance fighter, whose divided conscience is reflected in the drama of Nazi-occupied France and British-occupied India. That Noor strikes us a modern figure of heroism and doubt is because of the compelling vision of Shauna Singh Baldwin.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Marie-Claire Blais\n\nPraise for *What the Body Remembers:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A stunning first novel. Intensely atmospheric Ã¢â‚¬â€ an artistic triumph.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly* (starred review)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“An impressive achievement. . .rich, fascinating, epic. . . An original, extremely readable book that dramatizes the plight of Indian women with great sympathy and love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Gazette (Montreal)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A captivating jewel of a novel by a seasoned and sophisticated writer. . . Beyond being a compelling tale of individuals, What the Body Remembers offers a gimlet-eyed view of a pluralistic societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disintegration into factionalism and anarchy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\n\nFrom the author of What the Body Remembers, an extraordinary story of love and espionage, cultural tension and displacement, inspired by the life of Noor Inayat Khan (code name &quot;Madeleine&quot;), who worked against the Occupation after the Nazi invasion of France.\n\nWhen Noor Khan's father, a teacher of mystical Sufism, dies, Noor is forced to bow, along with her mother, sister and brother, to her uncle's religious literalism and ideas on feminine propriety.

Above, snow drifted against the glass and bars. Shreds of thoughts, speculations, obsessions ... some glue still held her fragments together.\n\nThe flap door clanged down.\n\n&quot;Herr Vogel...&quot;\n\nThe rest, in rapid German, was senseless.\n\nSilly hope reared inside; she reined it in.\n\nThe guard placed something on the thick, jutting tray, something invisible in the dingy half-light. Soup probably. She didn't care.\n\nShe heard a clunk and a small swish.\n\nYes, she did.*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac68b607eb7f1110e7cc5157bc0e896af4e78fe","amp;dn":"The+Tiger+Claw+-+Shauna+Singh+Baldwin.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac68b607eb7f1110e7cc5157bc0e896af4e78fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,198,139,96,126,183,241,17,14,124,197,21,123,192,232,150,175,78,120,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
