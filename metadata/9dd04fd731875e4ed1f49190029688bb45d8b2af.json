In this companion book, Bill Holmes uses easy-to-follow foldout drawings and precise dimensions to take you step-by-step through the process of designing and constructing your very own .50-caliber rifle easily and inexpensively. Find out this master gun maker's professional secrets to fashioning the receiver, barrel and accessories, bolt, trigger assembly, buttstock, scope mount, bipod and muzzle brake using commonly acquired materials. Once you have made all the component parts, Bill then instructs you in the right way to assemble and test-fire your new home workshop firearm. With Bill Holmes as your guide, construction is a snap. Warning: It is your responsibility to make sure that you have complied with all local, state and federal laws with regard to the manufacture of any firearm.\nAbout the Author\nBill Holmes is one of the last remaining links to a bygone era. He first learned about gunsmithing more than 50 years ago from a guy who took his &quot;fix-it&quot; wagon all around doing odd jobs. Since then, Bill has designed and constructed innumerable firearms, written seven books and been featured in two videos for Paladin and become one of the country's best-known and most highly respected authorities on home-workshop weapons and firearms laws.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 61 pages\n    * Publisher: Paladin Press (September 1, 2002)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1581603460\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1581603460","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd04fd731875e4ed1f49190029688bb45d8b2af","amp;dn":"The+.50+Caliber+Rifle+Construction+Manual%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd04fd731875e4ed1f49190029688bb45d8b2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,208,79,215,49,135,94,78,209,244,145,144,2,150,136,187,69,216,178,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
