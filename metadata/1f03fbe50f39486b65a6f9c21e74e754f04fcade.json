Each issue's last page(s) were revised for the TPB; the originals are included separately.\n\nSHORTS - Seven shorter (4 to 12 pages) stories, originally published in the two &quot;Origins&quot; issues as well as in the form of TPB extras. Each story is bookended with appropriate pinup artwork - which worked out rather well here, if I do say so myself!\n\nTHE ART OF CARBON GREY - ~130 pages of concept art. Original Digital Lo-Res release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f03fbe50f39486b65a6f9c21e74e754f04fcade","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Carbon+Grey+%28Image%7C2011-%26gt%3B%7CDgtl%7CEmpire%29+%26reg%3B1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f03fbe50f39486b65a6f9c21e74e754f04fcade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,3,251,229,15,57,72,107,101,166,249,194,30,116,231,84,240,79,202,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
