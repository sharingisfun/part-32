Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. To date they are one of the highest-grossing bands of all time.\n\nAC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all time best-seller, selling over 10,000 copies a day in its first week.\n\nThe band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Since then, the band's line-up has remained the same. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics, and the band's latest studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide.\n\nAs of 2010, AC/DC had sold more than 200 million albums worldwide, including 71 million albums in the United States alone. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the second-highest-selling album by any artist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ behind only Michael Jackson's Thriller Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and were named the seventh &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time&quot; by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Legendary producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as &quot;the greatest rock and roll band of all time.&quot; In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBallbreaker is the thirteenth Australian and twelfth international studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in September 1995. It was their first studio album in five years, since 1990's The Razors Edge. The album featured the return of Phil Rudd, who had been fired from the band in 1983 as a result of drinking and drug problems and a feud with Malcolm Young. It was produced by prolific producer Rick Rubin, who had briefly worked with AC/DC in 1993 to produce their single &quot;Big Gun&quot; for the soundtrack to the film Last Action Hero.\n\nProduction started at the Record Plant Studios in New York City, but the band became dissatisfied with the sound there and moved to Los Angeles' Ocean Way Studios.\n\nTwo weeks into the US leg of the Ballbreaker World Tour, four gigs were cancelled so that Brian Johnson could attend his father's funeral. During the tour, MTV cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead appeared in the intro during concerts. Five of the album's songs were played live: &quot;Hard as a Rock&quot;, &quot;Boogie Man&quot;, &quot;Cover You in Oil&quot;, &quot;Hail Caesar&quot;, and &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;.\n\nBallbreaker was re-released in 2005 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. It is currently certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in the US, for sales in excess of two million.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa36641a0c46463478aef41f47aee25a8989c54b","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Ballbreaker+%5B1995%5D%5B2008%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BJapan+Remaster%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa36641a0c46463478aef41f47aee25a8989c54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,54,100,26,12,70,70,52,120,174,244,31,71,174,226,90,137,137,197,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
