Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ebf002a94d1b6de22774fa8b9cc4be0685cbf0f","amp;dn":"Energy+Autonomy+-+Hermann+Scheer+-+Leader+Solar+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ebf002a94d1b6de22774fa8b9cc4be0685cbf0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,191,0,42,148,209,182,222,34,119,79,168,185,204,75,224,104,92,191,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
