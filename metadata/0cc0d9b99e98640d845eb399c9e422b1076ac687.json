While practising a particularly tricky juggling move, he accidentally taints a barrel of rum with tobacco, creating a potent and addictive brew which he coins Ã¢â‚¬ËœJolly RoverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, one of the most prized substances in the Caribbean.\n\nAlas, the wealth of Jolly Rover sales only manages to fill the pockets of his uncle, and Gaius longs for action and adventure and, more importantly, the opportunity to start his own circus and follow in the footsteps of his father.\n\nIt is not long before the fumbled juggling ball of opportunity raps Gaius smartly on the head yet again. While his uncle is away, a large contract for Jolly Rover arrives from Guy DeSilver, Governor of the notorious Groggy Island, with payment upfront!\n\nIn a blinding flurry of optimism, Gaius pools his meagre savings with this advance and charters a ship and crew to take him to Groggy Island. Along the way he meets a colourful band of seafaring cutthroats, scallywags and rogues otherwise known as pirates.\n\nIt is here we begin to follow the short and stubby tail of Gaius across three wild and untamed tropical islands, as he attempts to fulfil his dream of starting a circus, hampered only by pirates, villains, voodoo, love and considerable lack of loot.\n\nJolly Rover is a traditional 2D point and click adventure, including casual elements, such as an integrated hint system, and task bar. Bonus elements include unlockable Captain Bio's, music, concept art and developer commentary!\n\nKey features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Over 60 beautifully rendered scenes to explore\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 25 colourful, fully animated and voiced characters\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Traditional point and click adventure with simple one-click interface\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Organic and fully integrated hint and task tracking system\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Unlockable extras include Captain Bio's, concept art, music tracks and directors commentary\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cc0d9b99e98640d845eb399c9e422b1076ac687","amp;dn":"Jolly+Rover+%5BFINAL%5D+2013+%28PC%29+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cc0d9b99e98640d845eb399c9e422b1076ac687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,192,217,185,158,152,100,13,132,94,179,153,201,228,34,177,7,106,198,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
