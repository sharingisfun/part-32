It is a full scale production featuring world- class musicians, soloists, dancers, narrators, and music that leaves viewers in awe of the Choir's unmatched magnitude and musicality. Following the success of last year's CD Rejoice and Be Merry, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir presents Ring Christmas Bells, the next musical masterpiece in a series of highly acclaimed and commercially successful holiday albums. Featuring Brian Stokes Mitchell, dubbed by the New York Times as Broadway's last leading man and Edward Herrmann (Gilmore Girls; Nixon), Ring Christmas Bells is a holiday experience every family will want to have.
