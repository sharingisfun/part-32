This will unlock songs all the way up to &quot;Call me Maybe&quot;. This DOES NOT include any previous generation wads (sZAE, sZBE, sZCE, sZDE, sZEE, sZFE, sZJE, and sZKE) as they are already up-to-date and can easily be found in other torrents.\n\nI don't really care to explain how to install these wads, but you can easily Google it or perhaps find a write up from an older torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a622b4940f84667bcbf40db9019f45df4253dff8","amp;dn":"Rock+Band+3+DLC+Gen+9-10+wads+%5BNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a622b4940f84667bcbf40db9019f45df4253dff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,34,180,148,15,132,102,123,203,244,13,185,1,159,69,223,66,83,223,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
