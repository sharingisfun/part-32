He originally used the name for live DJ sets, but in 2009 the project moved into the studio with Skrillex remixing the likes of Lady Gaga (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad RomanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Snoop Dogg (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sensual SeductionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). In 2010, the self-released digital download EP My Name Is Skrillex appeared, combining the Benny Benassi and Deadmau5 styles of electro with the over the top samples and giant noises of acts like the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim. Moore would sign with Deadmau5Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Mau5trap label that same year, where he would release his second EP, Scary Monsters &amp; Nice Sprites, along with the club hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kill Everybody.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If topping the club charts didn't prove the producer had arrived, a 2011 appearance on the revived Beavis &amp; Butthead television series did, along with his collaboration with the surviving members of the Doors called &quot;Breakin' a Sweat.&quot; The recording of the track was captured in the documentary film RE:GENERATION, while the song itself landed on Skrillex's Bangarang EP, which appeared in early 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06d0379e061d42939c003fea2c71585e0dc24497","amp;dn":"Skrillex+-+Triple+Vinyl+Box+Set+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06d0379e061d42939c003fea2c71585e0dc24497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,208,55,158,6,29,66,147,156,0,63,234,44,113,88,94,13,194,68,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
