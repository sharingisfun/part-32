Whether itâ€™s the latest gadget youâ€™ve preordered online, or a new graphic novel you canâ€™t wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you donâ€™t miss the doorbell.\r\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping companyâ€™s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to.\r\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, City Link, Royal Mail, DPD, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries; If you have packages from other services, just select â€œOtherâ€ and enter a delivery date and web site. Deliveries will watch the site and let you know when it changes.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in version 2.0:\r\n- Complete iCloud sync: the entire state of your deliveries is now synced when you use iCloud. That includes the current status, which allows for faster and more efficient updates in many cases. It also includes archived and deleted items, so your archive should match across devices. (When syncing the first time, only the past 30 days will be included.)\r\n- See the full route: for many services, you can now see the path of where your package has been in addition to its current location. This makes sharing deliveries more fun too.\r\n- More ways to add deliveries: select text in another app (like Mail or Safari), right-click, choose &quot;Share&quot;, and then &quot;Add to Deliveries&quot;. Don't worry about selecting just the tracking number, it should find it if you select too much.\r\n- Clipboard detection: click the + button and youâ€™ll see suggestions based on your clipboard there. To add the first suggestion all you have to do is press return.\r\n- Swipe to archive: with a trackpad or Magic Mouse you can swipe to archive a delivery, or delete an already archived delivery.\r\n- A fresh look: the new system font is now used throughout, and an adjusted detail view focuses more on the information you care about.\r\n- Search for help: you can now search our support pages right in the Help menu.\r\nAdjustable split view: just drag the divider wherever you like.\r\n- For a delivery with multiple packages, you can now click the &quot;1 of 2&quot; badge in the list to show the next package.\r\nIf the main app is open, it will now respond instantly if you add a delivery with the &quot;Add to Deliveries&quot; extension.\r\n- Adding the same delivery more than once with the &quot;Add to Deliveries&quot; extension will now update the delivery instead of adding a duplicate. This change also addresses a bug where you might have gotten duplicates even though you only added it once.\r\n- The badge number on the icon should now roughly match the number of deliveries that have changed, instead of just increasing each time thereâ€™s a notification. If you archive a delivery from a notification or on another device, the number will decrease by one, and notifications for that delivery will be cleared.\r\n- If a delivery changes after itâ€™s delivered, and itâ€™s still showing as delivered, it will no longer trigger a notification. These changes are rarely of interest.\r\n- Previously if Notification Center was open and a delivery changed, you wouldnâ€™t get a notification. That is no longer the case, as long as the parent app is running.\r\n- When thereâ€™s a serious error, you now have the option of resetting the appâ€™s data.\r\n- New security features in OS X allow the app to enforce minimum security requirements when it connects to each service.\r\n- Significant improvements and bug fixes for Amazon orders.\r\nDHL UK tracking is now part of DHL Express.\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13fe929db213d64873a7cc2743b6fb5bc082f9b7","amp;dn":"Deliveries+2.0+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13fe929db213d64873a7cc2743b6fb5bc082f9b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,254,146,157,178,19,214,72,115,167,204,39,67,182,251,91,192,130,249,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
