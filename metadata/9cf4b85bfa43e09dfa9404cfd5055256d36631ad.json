The film is a pastiche using film clips from Republic serials, re-dubbed with comic dialog to tell a tale of world conquest by sex, drugs and rock and roll.\n\nIn the film, the Lightning Bug, embodied by garish villains from several serials, attempts to take over the world with rock and roll. He later adds sex and drugs when music alone doesn't work. He explains his changing appearance by saying, &quot;I'm bringing all five of my costumes!&quot; The Lightning Bug is voiced by legendary radio DJ M.G. Kelly (aka &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf4b85bfa43e09dfa9404cfd5055256d36631ad","amp;dn":"J+Men+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf4b85bfa43e09dfa9404cfd5055256d36631ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,244,184,91,250,67,224,157,250,148,4,207,213,5,82,86,211,102,49,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
