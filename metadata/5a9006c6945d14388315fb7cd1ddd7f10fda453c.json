More than fifty percent of the total world population is now interested in the same resources. This change of structure has caused enormous price increases on international commodity markets. In Europe this process can also be noticed in shortages of some mineral resources. National mineral resources policies play a decisive role here, and developing special policies is vital to creating a mineral resources strategy and ensuring a competitive mining industry. This book discusses the mineral resources policies and strategies of important mineral resources importing and exporting countries, examines the status quo of European mineral resources policy and puts forward proposals for the implementation of such a policy for discussion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a9006c6945d14388315fb7cd1ddd7f10fda453c","amp;dn":"General+and+International+Mineral+Policy%3A+Focus%3A+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a9006c6945d14388315fb7cd1ddd7f10fda453c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,144,6,198,148,93,20,56,131,21,251,124,209,221,215,241,15,218,69,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
