I utterly loathe my life.&quot;\nCatherine feels trapped. Her father is determined to marry her off to a rich man--any rich man, no matter how awful.\n\nBut by wit, trickery, and luck, Catherine manages to send several would-be husbands packing. Then a shaggy-bearded suitor from the north comes to call--by far the oldest, ugliest, most revolting suitor of them all.\n\nUnfortunately, he is also the richest.\n\nCan a sharp-tongued, high-spirited, clever young maiden with a mind of her own actually lose the battle against an ill-mannered, piglike lord and an unimaginative, greedy toad of a father?\n\nDeus! Not if Catherine has anything to say about it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65020b0d5b207dfef7ff06d76aae5638bcb83cef","amp;dn":"Catherine+Called+Birdy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65020b0d5b207dfef7ff06d76aae5638bcb83cef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,2,11,13,91,32,125,254,247,255,6,215,106,174,86,56,188,184,60,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
