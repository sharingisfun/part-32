The games can be played\nfrom Windows (tested on Windows XP), Linux (tested on Ubuntu 9.10)\nand as the title says, the CD is bootable, which gives you the\nability to play the games in pure MS-DOS mode or from the built-in\nLinux distribution (Slax 6.1.2) provided along with the games.\n\nMoreover, the games can easily be copied or installed on your hard\ndrive, USB flash device or any other writable media. Starting from\nversion 3.1, the CD comes with extended usability support for DOS,\nWindows, and Linux.\n\n==========\nHOW TO USE\n==========\n\nThere are many (and I mean really many) ways to run the games:\n\n1) (Windows) Put the CD in your CD-ROM device (or mount with Daemon\n   Tools) and then double click on the CD icon located in My Computer.\n   Now you have the option to play the games directly. In this mode\n   the games will be installed in your Windows TEMP directory.\n\n2) (Linux) Restart the computer and boot from the CD. Choose one of\n   the Slax related boot options. A system with 1GB RAM or more is\n   required. After Slax has started, you will find a shortcut on\n   the desktop, from which you can start the games.\n   \n3) (MS-DOS) Restart the computer and boot from the CD. Choose the\n   MS-DOS 7.1 boot option. A system with 64MB RAM or more is required.\n   Most of the games might not work well though, as this mode is\n   'last resort of hope' and is kind of unsupported... sorry.\n\n4) (Windows, Linux) Copy ALL files and directories from the CD to any\n   directory you want. In this mode you  will have the option to play\n   the games directly or install them automatically to the folder\n   'playgame' (if the folder is writable). You need to run 'Games.exe'\n   for Windows or execute the command 'sh games.sh' in termainal console\n   for Linux in order to play the games in this mode. If you have done\n   this on your USB flash device, you can easily make it bootable later.\n\n5) (Windows, Linux) Navigate to the folder 'slax' =&gt; 'rootcopy' and\n   copy the 'dosgames' folder which resides in 'rootcopy' to any\n   location at your choice. Inside 'dosgames' you will find additional\n   set of startup files ('Games.exe' for Windows and 'games.sh' for Linux).\n   In this way you can't make bootable USB flash device but you are\n   preserving space as you are not copying the built-in Slax distribution.\n   The games are fully loadable and playable. This option is useful\n   when for example you already have a bootable USB flash device and you\n   just want to be able to play the provided games.\n\n6) (Windows) Choose 'Install Games' from the context menu of your\n   CD-ROM device. There is another option in the same context menu\n   which allows you to uninstall the games later.\n\n7) Youse a PC emulator like 'VMware Player', 'Qemu' or 'Virtual Box'.\n   These virtualization solutions are free and publicly available.\n   After you have obtained, installed and configured one of them, you\n   can try one of the options explained above.\n\nRegardless the way you start the system, you will see the same text\nbased menu from which you can choose an item to run.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the games may not run well in MS-DOS mode!!!\n\n==========\nWHAT'S NEW\n==========\n\n- No new games provided. The last update of the game list was done\n  in version 2.4, which was quite a long time ago.\n- Ability to play the games directly from CD or USB in Linux mode.\n- Added extensive usability support for generic Linux distributions\n  with possibility to play the games directly from CD, USB flash\n  device, or any other readable media.\n- The game menu is slightly reorganized. Added new 'Exit' option.\n- Updated the built-in DOSBox emulator to version 0.73 (Windows).\n\n==============\nINCLUDED GAMES\n==============\n\nDOS(Box) Games Bootable CD version 3.1 contains the following games:\n\n- Lotus III\n- Chuck Yeager's Air Combat\n- Mario\n- Across\n- Arcade Volleyball\n- Prince of Persia\n- Ugh\n- Grand Prix Circuit\n- Brix\n- Battle Chess\n- Dangerous Dave\n- Mortal Kombat\n- NBA Lakers vs. Celtics\n- Sharkey's 3D Pool\n- Tetris\n- Fritz 2\n- CD Man 2\n- Prehistorik 2\n- Prehistorik\n- Space Invaders\n- The Lost Vikings\n- Death Track\n- Golden Axe\n- Nethack\n- Pinball World\n- Red Baron\n- Sokoban\n- Titus The Fox\n- Tristan Pinball\n- Wolfenstein 3D\n- Spear of Destiny 1\n- Spear of Destiny 2\n- Spear of Destiny 3\n- Space Hog\n- One Must Fall\n- Fairy Godmother\n- Block-O-Mania\n- Cochese\n- Clone\n- MS Packman\n- Night Ride\n- Sky Roads\n- Black Thorne\n- Bubble Pop\n- Tomb Raider\n- Jazz Jackrabbit\n- Crazy Cars III\n- Push Over\n- Bubble Bobble\n- Win, Lose or Draw\n- Arkanoid\n- Alien Breed\n- Eliza\n- Alien Carnage\n- Doom 2\n- 100+ Windows 3.x Games\n- Raptor\n- Block Out\n- Blocks From Hell\n- Civilization\n- Dune 2\n- Master of Orion\n- Warcraft I\n- War Lords\n- The Incredible Machine\n- H2O\n- Aliens Doom\n- Heretic &amp; Expansion\n- Oblige Doom\n- Plutonia\n- Randoom\n- The Proving Grounds\n- Evilution (TNT)\n- Ultimate Doom\n- Batman Doom\n- Alien Cabal\n- Hexen Beyond Heretic\n- Hexen Expansion Pack\n- Mortal Kombat II\n- Return of Triad\n- Warcraft II\n- Xenon II Megablast\n- Ford Simulator 5.0\n- Kwik Snax\n- Pong\n- The 7 Cities of Gold\n- Aladdin\n- Battle Chess 4000\n- BC Racers\n- Carnage\n- Cyber Empire\n- Doom 2D\n- Death Rally\n- Dune\n- Dynablaster\n- Fire &amp; Ice\n- Goblins II\n- Goblins III\n- Gods\n- License to Kill\n- Bad Street Brawler\n- Caesar\n- Grand Prix Motors\n- Indiana Jones III\n- Indiana Jones IV\n- Karateka\n- Commander Keen 1\n- Commander Keen 2\n- Commander Keen 3\n- Commander Keen 4\n- Commander Keen 5\n- Commander Keen 6\n- Commander Keen 7\n- King's Quest 1\n- Krypton Egg\n- The Legend of Kyrandia\n- Lamborghini\n- Lemmings Holiday\n- Lemmings Classic\n- Lemmings Xmas\n- Liero\n- Lords of The Realm\n- Monkey Islands II\n- Pinball Fantasies\n- Serf City\n- Syndicate\n- Super Speed Deluxe\n- Theme Park\n- Transport Tykoon Mars\n- Tyrian\n- UFO Enemy Unknown\n- XWing\n- Catacombs III\n- Day of The Tentacle\n- Duke Nukum I\n- Eye of The Beholder I\n- Eye of The Beholder II\n- Eye of The Beholder III\n- World Cup USA '94\n- Hi Octane\n- King's Bounty\n- King's Quest II\n- King's Quest III\n- King's Quest IV\n- King's Quest V\n- Legend of Kyrandia II\n- Lode Runner\n- Mario Bros\n- One Must Fall (Full)\n- Voodoo Island\n- Jump Jet\n- Railroad Tycoon\n- Sam &amp; Max\n- Space Quest I\n- Space Quest I (VGA)\n- Space Quest II\n- Space Quest III\n- Space Quest IV\n- Space Quest V\n- Space Quest 'Lost Chapter'\n- Stratego\n- Tank\n- Test Drive I\n- Test Drive III\n- Zeliard\n- 4K Adventure\n- Princess Alandria\n- Another World\n- ACiD Tetris\n- Bureau 13\n- Bad Blood\n- Realms of Arkania\n- Ancient Empires\n- Classic Concentration II\n- Dark Half\n- Disc World\n- Escape From Delirium\n- Hitchhiker's Guide\n- Hocus Pocus\n- Hoyle Card Games\n- Inspector Gadget\n- KGB\n- King's Quest I (VGA)\n- King's Quest VI\n- Laura Bow II\n- Lost in Time\n- Police Quest I\n- Police Quest III\n- Quest for Glory I\n- Red Hell\n- Wild Science Arcade\n- Shadowcaster\n- Simon the Sorcerer I\n- Simon the Sorcerer II\n- Strike Squad\n- Total Carnage\n- Veil of Darkness\n- Zork Zero\n\n======================\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n======================\n\nWhen you start the games, the provided executables and scripts will\ncheck if the media you are running the games from is read only or\nwith read/write permissions. For example, a CD is a read only meadia,\nwhile the HDD device is usually with read/write permissions enabled.\n\nAnyway, the system is 'smart' and if the media is 'read only', then\nthe games are unpacked to your temporary folder, which location is\nspecific for your operating system. Usually it is called 'TEMP' or\n'TMP' on Windows and '/tmp' on Linux. Although you still can save\nand load games, the OS has the final decision when to wipe the\ntemporary folder, which means that your saves are not safe if you\nplay for a long time from read only device.\n\nOn the other hand, if the system detects a read/write enabled media,\nthen your games are unpacked to the relative folder 'playgame', which\ncan be found at 'slax' =&gt; 'rootcopy' =&gt; 'dosgames' =&gt; 'playgame'. In\nthis way you are assured that all your saved games are at safe location\nand that they will not be wiped out unless you do it yourself. For\nexample you can delete the content of the folder or use the text based\nmenu to uninstall the game you wish to remove.\n\nIn Linux you will need to have DOSBox preinstalled but even if you don't\nhave it, the provided scripts (games.sh in particualr) will show you how\nto install it for Ubuntu. The process is similar for other distributions\nand I hope that since you are using Linux, you know what you are doing.\n\nIf you use the CD in DOSBox mode, you have the option to install each\nitem to your HDD or USB flash. This feature enables you to start the\ngames faster (unpack game only the first time) and your saves are now\nreally saved, so you can really load them later! This was already\nmentioned above, but it doesn't hurt to remind it. :)\n\nOnce an item is installed, you have the option to uninstall it. This is\navailable ONLY for previously installed items.\n\nYou also have the option to install permanently all items from this CD\nto your HDD or USB flash device. All you need to do is to follow these\neasy to do steps:\n\nFirst option (Windows, Linux): \n\n1) Copy ALL files and folders from the CD to the location you want. This\n   is mandatory if you have copied the files to your USB flash device and\n   you intend to make it bootable later.\n2) Start the system via 'Games.exe' (for Windows).\n   Start the system by executing 'sh games.sh' from console (for Linux).\n\nSecond option (Windows, Linux): \n\n1) Copy tyhe content of 'slax' =&gt; 'rootcopy' =&gt; 'dosgames' folder from\n   the CD to the location you want. Please be aware that in this way you\n   can't make your USB flash device bootable. Suitable if you have less\n   space available on the destination drive, or if you don't intend to\n   make the targeted device bootable.\n2) Start the system via 'Games.exe' (for Windows).\n   Start the system by executing 'sh games.sh' from console (for Linux).\n\nThird option (Windows):\n\n1) From the context menu of your CD-ROM device choose 'Install Games'.\n2) Start the system via 'Games.exe' (or create shortcut for this file).\n\nTo create a bootable USB flash device, follow these instructions:\n\n1) Copy ALL files and folders from the CD to the root directory of your\n   USB flash device.\n2) Navigate to the folder 'boot' and execute 'bootinst.bat' (Windows)\n   or 'bootinst.sh' (Linux). Then you just need to follow the provided\n   instructions and if everything goes fine, you will be able to boot\n   from your USB flash device.\n\nDue to design issues the games on this CD will not work well in pure\nMS-DOS mode if you have more than one physical CD-ROM device. In this\ncase you should choose the alternative boot option from the MS-DOS\nsection and then load the games manually. Yo need to know how to work\nwith MS-DOS text console in order to do that and since the majority of\nthe modern society have no idea how to do that, please try some of the\nother available options first. For example if you use the system as\nbootable media, you may first try to play the games from the built-in\nLinux distribution insted from the pure 'legacy' MS-DOS mode.\n\nHave fun! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f84cfab08ebfaeadcc56b356c0978422a23157","amp;dn":"DOS%28Box%29+Games+Bootable+CD+Version+3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f84cfab08ebfaeadcc56b356c0978422a23157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,248,76,250,176,142,191,174,173,204,86,179,86,192,151,132,34,162,49,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
