It unfolds a story of being found in God, choosing to search outside of God, and finally, being redeemed and restored to the One and only God. Ultimately, Forever Yours is an array of worship-expression praise, adoration, confession, and redemption are heard throughout the album, with the signature sound and powerful lyrics that identify Gateway Worship. This album is filled with beautiful moments of inspiration, and heart-felt anthems of gratitude that celebrate more than anything else, that we are forever His. \n\nGateway Worship, the worship experience of the 24,000 member Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas, is set to release their new live worship album Forever Yours through in:ciite media and EMI Distribution on October 9, 2012. Forever Yours is an array of worship-expression with praise, adoration, confession, and redemption heard throughout, with the signature sound and powerful lyrics that identify Gateway Worship.\n\n&quot;When we first began talking about recording Forever Yours, we knew that it was going to be more than just a CD release; we were committed to the message of redemption and the truth that as Believers in Christ, we belong to Him and are forever His,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ said Thomas Miller, worship pastor for Gateway. ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£This album is an experience that takes you into the truth of redemption and leads you to catch a glimpse of the power of restoration woven throughout the album with the gift of worship.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥\n\nProduced by Walker Beach, Forever Yours contains 13 new songs from the worship team including ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£The Fathers Love,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Be Lifted Higher,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£We Will See,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ and the title track ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Forever Yours.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ The CD tells a story of coming closer to God, being found in God, and being redeemed and restored by God. This remarkable music flows from an equally remarkable collective. Comprised of worship leaders, singers and songwriters, GatewayÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s worship team offers a rich tapestry of experience, talent and perspective. Team members include Miller, Beach, Sion Alford, Zach Neese, David Moore, Jason Tam and Dove Award-Winning artist Kari Jobe.\n\nÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£We are honored to continue our long-term partnership with Gateway Worship with the release of Forever Yours,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ said Chris Thomason, CEO of in:ciite media. ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Forever Yours captures the authentic heart of Gateway Worship, and the songs birthed through Gateway Church. ItÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s an incredible worship offering captured to help others enter God's presence.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥\n\nThrough multiple brands branching from Gateway Church such as GatewayNEXT, worship for children's ministry launched last fall, and their vast community, Gateway has sold CDs into the millions; however, the numbers are of little importance. The mission, that is more important than the music itself, has become an essential part of GatewayÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s culture and remains constant both in the studio and before any gathered body of believers; it is a commitment to leading the Body into a place of intimate worship and an understanding of the power of worship.\n\nIf you like the music, buy the album here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.gatewaypeople.com/home.php?cat=283&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.gatewaypeople.com/home.php?cat=283&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis album is also available in FLAC: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8607221/Gateway_Worship_-_Forever_Yours&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8607221/Gateway_Worship_-_Forever_Yours&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOther Gateway Worship Torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8632923/Gateway_Worship_-_Gateway_Next_-_Look_Up&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8632923/Gateway_Worship_-_Gateway_Next_-_Look_Up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8632922/Gateway_Next_-_Look_Up_(Flac)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8632922/Gateway_Next_-_Look_Up_(Flac)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8608285/Gateway_Worship_-_Der_Her_Regiert&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8608285/Gateway_Worship_-_Der_Her_Regiert&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8607342/Gateway_Worship_-_The_First_10_Years_(Flac)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8607342/Gateway_Worship_-_The_First_10_Years_(Flac)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8607237/Gateway_Worship_-_The_First_10_Years&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8607237/Gateway_Worship_-_The_First_10_Years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6834805/Gateway_Worship_-_Great_Great_God_(2011)_Deluxe_Edition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6834805/Gateway_Worship_-_Great_Great_God_(2011)_Deluxe_Edition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6690244/Gateway_Worship_-_God_Be_Praised_(2010)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6690244/Gateway_Worship_-_God_Be_Praised_(2010)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7544398/Gateway_Worship_Discography_2000-2012_(10_Releases)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7544398/Gateway_Worship_Discography_2000-2012_(10_Releases)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b72fdc6f88100ef4ab019472f5edf8d767fb8c","amp;dn":"Gateway+Worship+-+Forever+Yours+%28MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b72fdc6f88100ef4ab019472f5edf8d767fb8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,183,47,220,111,136,16,14,244,171,1,148,114,245,237,248,215,103,251,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
