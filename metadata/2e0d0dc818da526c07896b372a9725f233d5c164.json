Woodstock) \r\n02 Stairway To Heaven \r\n03 Whole Lotta Love \r\n04 The Crunge\r\n05 Black Dog\r\n\r\nComments: A much better show than the night before. Robert's ego is gone and \r\nthe band turns in a much better, tighter performance. Trampled Underfoot is \r\nvery heavy and a great version and Dazed And Confused is intense and very long. \r\nThe Crunge is inserted in Whole Lotta Love and is very funky and fast and leads \r\ninto a monstrous Black Dog. Robert's voice is very strong and solid and he \r\nperforms some great vocal variations in In My Time Of Dying and Kashmir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0d0dc818da526c07896b372a9725f233d5c164","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.05+Dallas%2C+Texas+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0d0dc818da526c07896b372a9725f233d5c164","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,13,13,200,24,218,82,108,7,137,107,55,42,151,37,242,51,213,193,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
