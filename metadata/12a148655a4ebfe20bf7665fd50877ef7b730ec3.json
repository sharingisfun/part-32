A martial arts tournament is set up by Unknown Nemesis (Tien Feng) as a pretext to lure rival martial artists into a trap. Word of this treachery reaches Wang Yu and he reluctantly leaves his farm and wife (Chiao Chiao, returning from the first film) to free the imprisoned swordsmen and wreak vengeance on Unknown Nemesis. After the first half-hour the film is virtually nonstop bloodshed and swordplay, all beautifully photographed on lavish Shaw Bros. studio sets.\n\nFuture kung fu star Ti Lung appears as an ill-fated fighter in an early scene with crafty villainess Essie Lin Chia. The fight choreography is by Tang Chia and Liu Chia Liang (Lau Kar Leung), who would both have a great impact on the kung fu films of the 1970s. While Wang Yu went on to star in ONE-ARMED BOXER, he never again played a one-armed fighter in a Shaw Bros. film. When Wang Yu left Shaw Bros., Chang Cheh made THE NEW ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN (aka TRIPLE IRONS, 1971) with David Chiang in the title role and Ti Lung in support.\n\n\nDate ...............: february 28 1969\nRuntime ............: 1hr 45m\nSize ...............: 2.52 GB\nVideo ..............: 1280x546\nBitrate ............: 2750 kbps (x264 &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;236b4a444b636f170d12&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\nAudio ..............: Chinese AC3 5.1 Ch 448 kbps\nAudio ..............: English AC3 2.0 Ch 224 kbps\nChapters............: Yes\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12a148655a4ebfe20bf7665fd50877ef7b730ec3","amp;dn":"Return+of+the+One-Armed+Swordsman+%281969%29+m-720p+BluRay+AC3+-+Mor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12a148655a4ebfe20bf7665fd50877ef7b730ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,161,72,101,90,78,191,226,11,247,102,95,213,8,119,239,123,115,14,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
