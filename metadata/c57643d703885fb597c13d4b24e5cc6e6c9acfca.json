It is the second single release from his second studio album, The Man I Want to Be, released on September 1, 2009. Young co-wrote the song with Kent Blazy and Cory Batten.\n\n&quot;Gettin' You Home&quot; is a mid-tempo where the male narrator plans to take his lover out on a date. Although he says that he loves to show her off, and that she loves to get dressed up, all he can think about is &quot;gettin' [her] home&quot; to have sex with her.\n\nKarlie Justus of The 9513 gave &quot;Gettin' You Home&quot; a thumbs-up. She described the song as &quot;pleasingly radio-friendly without feeling like a sell-out, and it should catapult Young into the very small club of successful country reality competition winners.&quot; Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A- rating. His review called it &quot;suggestive without being sleazy.&quot; Matt Bjorke, in his review of the album, said that the song &quot;is sultry and sexy without ever feeling like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pandering to anybody. Also, despite the R&amp;B grooves in the mix, the song is nothing but country.&quot;\n\n&quot;Gettin' You Home&quot; debuted at #60 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated for February 28, 2009. It later debuted at #91 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in August 2009 and has since moved up to #33. It became his first Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart dated for October 24, 2009, making Young the first Nashville Star contestant to have a Number One.\n\nThe Man I Want to Be is the second studio album of American country music artist Chris Young. It was released on September 1, 2009 via RCA Nashville. The lead-off single, &quot;Voices&quot;, was released in May 2008, and peaked at #37 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Young's first Top 40 country hit.
