It happens. Your 47th cup of Joe doesn't seem to be\nproviding any pick-me up. You wonder to yourself, &quot;What can I do to get out of this\nslump?&quot; The answer is 15th and Hope, the latest release from American pop-rock Indie band Miggs. If this lyrically driven CD, with its uplifting feel good beats and positive yet emotionally charged message, doesn't do it for you then nothing will.\n\nThough described as &quot;The best band you've never heard of&quot; Miggs has seemed to find\ntheir niche with this effort. It flows smoothly from top to bottom with the exception of the final track &quot;The Way It Is&quot; which doesn't seem to groove with the rest of the\nalbum.\n\nAt first listen you may wonder if Soul Asylum decided to reunite, refine and modernize their sound. The first song off of the release, &quot;Pretty&quot;, you could easily hear as background music at any coffee house or on any teen oriented drama.  It's very uplifting and lyrically thought provoking.  Second out of the gate is the song &quot;Stars.&quot;  It is another real standout on this release; equally uplifting with a positive feel-good vibe. On the song &quot;Heart Full of Doubt&quot; you're about to be church-ed. Miggs takes you to the altar with some groovy organ sounds that start and finish the track. The only song that doesn't have that uplifting and positive feel on this CD is &quot;Hole&quot; but it's still a great song and just shows that the band can be versatile. Overall a very solid effort from this band of 10 years.\n\nWhether you are 15 and need some hope or you're an adult having a bad week, 15th and Hope is the perfect drug for that positive fix.\n\nJocko VonSpuken,  RockRevolt Magazine\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Pretty                                               [04:19]\n02.Stars                                                [04:19]\n03.Full of doubt                                        [04:23]\n04.Hole                                                 [04:09]\n05.Home                                                 [03:28]\n06.Monsters                                             [03:24]\n07.Everyone but me                                      [03:31]\n08.On your own side                                     [03:38]\n09.Fairy tales and miracles                             [03:44]\n10.Hand over your heart                                 [03:42]\n11.Save me                                              [04:03]\n12.The way it is                                        [06:37]\n________\n49:17 min\n 74,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
