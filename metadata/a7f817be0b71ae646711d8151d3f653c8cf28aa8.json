Its many pieces cover a huge variety of styles and textures, and the rousing theme, &quot;O Fortuna&quot; has to be one of the most gripping and well-known themes around, used commonly to accompany scenes of horror and terror in TV and film. It is an outstanding piece from a composer who is perhaps less well-known than he should be. The piece is sung in Latin, with occasional German passages, which is probably just as well, as an English version would merit an &quot;18&quot; certificate! (I have it under good authority that the lyrics are very crude indeed) The piece can be dark and harrowing, yet in other sections cheerful and frivolous, and I believe it would be hard to find such an amazing variety of music on one CD. Brilliant. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f817be0b71ae646711d8151d3f653c8cf28aa8","amp;dn":"Carl+Orff+-+Carmina+Burana+-+Andre+Previn+%28VBR+-+V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f817be0b71ae646711d8151d3f653c8cf28aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,248,23,190,11,113,174,100,103,17,216,21,29,63,101,60,140,242,138,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
