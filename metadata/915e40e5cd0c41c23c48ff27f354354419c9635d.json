Most artists sleepwalk through Christmas albums, but Bieber took this release so seriously that he co-wrote nine of its 15 songs and was motivated to tweet, Ã¢â‚¬Å“forget the hype...i want it to be about the music. listen to the cd. then judge me.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bieber definitely sounds more enthused by the original songs -- some of which resemble everyday numbers with patched-on seasonal references -- and a cover of Mariah Carey's Ã¢â‚¬Å“All I Want for Christmas Is YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featuring Carey herself). The versions of holiday staples are pulled off with varying results; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little Drummer BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets a goofy modernized spin with Busta Rhymes, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Santa Claus Is Coming to TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lifts bits of the Jackson 5's Ã¢â‚¬Å“ABCÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Want You BackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (rather than echoing the Jacksons' version of the song). Some of the Bieber fan base might be a little miffed that the inspirational ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pray,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ included on My Worlds Acoustic, makes another appearance here. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also the fact that Bieber (still) has yet to release a standard full-length album. He has two EP-length releases, a compilation of those two releases, a set of (mostly) acoustic versions, an EP-length remixes/documentary tie-in disc, and now a holiday album, to his name.\nAll Music Review by Andy Kellman  \n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas\n[02] Mistletoe\n[03] The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) - - - Justin Bieber Featuring Usher\n[04] Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\n[05] Fa La La - - - Justin Bieber Featuring Boyz II Men\n[06] All I Want For Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!) - - - Justin Bieber &amp; Mariah Carey\n[07] Drummer Boy - - - Justin Bieber Featuring Busta Rhymes\n[08] Christmas Eve\n[09] All I Want Is You\n[10] Home This Christmas - - - Justin Bieber Featuring The Band Perry\n[11] Silent Night\n[12] Christmas Love\n[13] Fa La La [A Cappella] - - - Justin Bieber Featuring Boyz II Men\n[14] Pray\n[15] Someday At Christmas\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:50m:34s\n\nMusic Video Track Listings\n\n[01] Justin Bieber - In The Studio Making Of The Album\n[02] Justin Bieber - Making Of Mistletoe Video\n[03] Justin Bieber - Pray\n\n\nTotal File Size....................... 669mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Videos, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
