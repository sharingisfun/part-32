In presenting an idiosyncratically distorted embodiment (or perhaps, resurrection) of fringe society through a sensitive, misunderstood, outcast savior plagued by self-doubt and dispirited by a pervasive sense of impotence against the weight of human suffering, Garrel illustrates, not only the profound loneliness and alienation caused by a singularity of vision (a recurring idealized representation of the May 68 generation as well-intentioned holy innocents that seeks kinship not only with the abstracted heroes of Carl Theodor Dreyer&amp;#039;s cinema - most notably, The Passion of Joan of Arc and Ordet - but also posits their intrinsic state of immanence, as revealed through their allusive alter-ego&amp;#039;s consuming empathy for the oppressed and the marginalized (an altruistic desire for connectedness that is reflected in Jesus&amp;#039; despair over the seemingly anachronistic sight of bohemians being harassed by authorities within the sanctity of their own commune-like cavern dwellings).\n\n\nWWW.MAKINGOFF.ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16f9d74e1c1cf9391014ffb259ec6361601e9fdf","amp;dn":"Le+lit+de+la+vierge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16f9d74e1c1cf9391014ffb259ec6361601e9fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,249,215,78,28,28,249,57,16,20,255,178,89,236,99,97,96,30,159,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
