His credits include XMEN, LETHAL WEAPON, MR HOLLAND&amp;#039;S OPUS, and DIE HARD. \n\nThis recording reunites Michael Kamen with the great sax artist DAVID SANBORN, who, along with guitar legend ERIC CLAPTON, had collaborated on the scores for the LETHAL WEAPON films. The composition follows the classic concerto form, featuring the saxophone soloist with full symphony orchestra. Kamen&amp;#039;s sound is immediately identifiable, and the music is immediately listenable. \n\nThis recording was made with limited number of presses in 1991 and is virtually unavailable today. The full digital fidelity is outstanding. The source CD encoded to MP3 at 256kps with the LAME codec at highest quality. \n\nEnjoy!
