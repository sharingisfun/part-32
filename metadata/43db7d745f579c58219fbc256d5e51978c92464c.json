In their new book, Stephen Hawking\n           and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific\n           thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in \n           nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and \n           simplicity....\n           \n           Notes:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43db7d745f579c58219fbc256d5e51978c92464c","amp;dn":"The.Grand.Design.-.Stephen.W.Hawking.EPUB-AMiGOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43db7d745f579c58219fbc256d5e51978c92464c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,219,125,116,95,87,156,88,33,159,188,37,109,94,81,151,140,146,70,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
