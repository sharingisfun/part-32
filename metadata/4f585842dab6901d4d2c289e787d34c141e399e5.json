The humour sometimes descends into uninspiring childish toilet humour, and it's not immune to getting laughs out of the mentally-challenged, but thanks to a priceless deadpan performance from David McPhail as the title character, this crude, dry and utterly hilarious take on New Zealand school life is wickedly un-PC comedy brilliance. We don't get much New \nZealand television here in Australia, but this one's a gem. 8/10\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f585842dab6901d4d2c289e787d34c141e399e5","amp;dn":"Seven+Periods+With+Mr+Gormsby+-+Series+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f585842dab6901d4d2c289e787d34c141e399e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,88,88,66,218,182,144,29,77,44,40,158,120,125,52,193,65,227,153,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
