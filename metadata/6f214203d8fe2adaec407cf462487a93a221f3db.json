The US and the EU are the main proponents of the agreement, and the authors of most joint changes, which also covers cross-border data flow. In a significant anti-transparency manoeuvre by the parties, the draft has been classified to keep it secret not just during the negotiations but for five years after the TISA enters into force.\n\nDespite the failures in financial regulation evident during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis and calls for improvement of relevant regulatory structures, proponents of TISA aim to further deregulate global financial services markets. The draft Financial Services Annex sets rules which would assist the expansion of financial multi-nationals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mainly headquartered in New York, London, Paris and Frankfurt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ into other nations by preventing regulatory barriers. The leaked draft also shows that the US is particularly keen on boosting cross-border data flow, which would allow uninhibited exchange of personal and financial data.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f214203d8fe2adaec407cf462487a93a221f3db","amp;dn":"Secret+Trade+in+Services+Agreement+%28TISA%29+-+Financial+Services+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f214203d8fe2adaec407cf462487a93a221f3db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,33,66,3,216,254,42,218,236,64,124,244,98,72,122,147,162,33,243,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
