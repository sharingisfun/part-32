He is the numberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“one goalie in the game today, and one of the greatest goaltenders of the modern age. He has been netminder for the New Jersey Devils for 13 years, leading them to three Stanley Cup victories and winning numerous individual awards in the process, including two Vezina trophies. A threeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“time Olympian for Canada, Brodeur was part of the goldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“medal winning team at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He was in goal when Team Canada captured the 2004 World Cup and has been a part of every major Canadian team since he broke into the NHL in 1992. He is rated as the fourth most popular and recognizable hockey player of all time (after Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Orr, and Mario Lemieux).
