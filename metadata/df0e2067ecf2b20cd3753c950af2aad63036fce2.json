Dingle was an English astrophysicist who spent his late days trying to convince the world that Einstein&amp;#039;s theory was self-contradictory and simply absurd. In this rare book he uses simple and common sense language with some math as necessary to demonstrate how unnatural this theory really is, especially when it comes to the clock or twin paradox. Dingle was mostly ignored by mainstream physics community who still continues the same old road of brainwashing the next generations with completely absurd physical theories. Today we know that at least part of what he wrote about is based on sound logic and that the Theory of relativity should be discarded and replaced with a better one. 100 pages. A must read for everyone.\n\nSome book webreviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.heretical.com/science/dingle1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.heretical.com/science/dingle1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mrelativity.net/Papers/18/Ricker.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mrelativity.net/Papers/18/Ricker.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df0e2067ecf2b20cd3753c950af2aad63036fce2","amp;dn":"Dingle+-+Science+at+the+Crossroads+%28refutes+Einstein%5C%27s+Theory+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df0e2067ecf2b20cd3753c950af2aad63036fce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,14,32,103,236,242,178,12,211,117,60,149,10,242,170,214,48,54,252,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
