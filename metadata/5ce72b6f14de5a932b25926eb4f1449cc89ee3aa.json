Date: 12 October 2010\nGame Type: Shooter\n======\n\n======\nABOUT GAME..\nOperating directly under the National Command Authority, a relatively unknown entity of handpicked warriors are called on when the mission must not fail.\n\nThey are the Tier 1 Operators.\nOver 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines wear the uniform.\n\nOf those, approximately 50 thousand fall under the direct control of the Special Operations Command. The Tier 1 Operator functions on a plane of existence above and beyond even the most highly trained Special Operations Forces. Their exact numbers, while classified, hover in the low hundreds. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war. They are experts in the application of violence. The new Medal of Honor is inspired by and has been developed with Tier 1 Operators from this elite community. Players will step into the boots of these warriors and apply their unique skill sets to a new enemy in the most unforgiving and hostile battlefield conditions of present day Afghanistan.\n\nThere is a new enemy. There is a new war. There is a new warrior. He is Tier 1.\n======\n\n\nCrack Install Instruction:\nUnpack &quot;Medal.of.Honor.CrackOnly-TheRipper(PR0PER).7z&quot; .\nCopy &quot;loader.dll&quot; and &quot;moh.exe&quot; to the main game folder (located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Electronic Arts\\Medal of Honor\\Binaries) and overwrite existing files there .\nHave Fun Playing The Game MEDAL OF HONOR!\n\nTheripper notez: If you get a virus/trojan warning, thats a false positive (its trusted)...\n\nPlease Share/Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce72b6f14de5a932b25926eb4f1449cc89ee3aa","amp;dn":"Medal.of.Honor.CrackOnly-TheRipper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce72b6f14de5a932b25926eb4f1449cc89ee3aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,231,43,111,20,222,90,147,43,37,146,110,180,241,68,156,200,158,227,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
