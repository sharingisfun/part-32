But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1905041/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1905041/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Thriller\niMDB Rating: 7,6/10 from 71 472 users\nDirector: Justin Lin\nStarring: Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker\nRelease Title: Fast and Furious 6 2013 TS Audio Fix XviD READNFO-*THC*\nRelease Date: 17.06.2013\nVideoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: XviD 1325Kbps\nAudioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: English MP3 128Kbps\nResolution: 720Ãƒâ€”320\nSizeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: 1.25GB\nRuntimeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦: 2h 2mn\n\nSource: German PSO\nAudio: a good friend/ Kingstoner and THC V1\n\nWorkdone:\nVideo was nice, just needed some brighting up and other small stuff to make it look better. Main reason for the readnfo is the audio. The line audio was garbage during any high action scenes. So we first clean up the line audio and clean up our Cam version audio of our first release and added CAM audio to every part that was a action scene, a total of 7 parts we did. This wasnt easy at all. We had to watch the whole movie and write down all the spot so we can cut and past audio. Syncing the CAM audio with the line audio was the bigest main in the butt, spent a total of 12 hours doing this release, Found it well worth it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/g/5HyYrqpxY5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/g/5HyYrqpxY5&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23e7335fad66c8ebdfca198590c3975b309a435","amp;dn":"Fast+and+Furious+6+2013+TS+Audio+Fix+XviD+READNFO-THC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23e7335fad66c8ebdfca198590c3975b309a435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,62,115,53,250,214,108,142,189,252,161,152,89,12,57,117,179,9,164,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
