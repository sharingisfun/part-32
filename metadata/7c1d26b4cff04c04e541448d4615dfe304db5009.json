When an English lord is captured by a Sioux Indian tribe, he is given to the chiefÃ‚Â´s aging mother (DAME JUDITH ANDERSON) as a servant. Gradually, he embraces the tribeÃ‚Â´s way of life and falls in love with the CheifÃ‚Â´s sister. But before he can be accepted with honor as an equal member of the tribe, he must endure the Sun Vow - a savage ritual far beyond the realm on anything dreamed of in the civilized world. \n\nDirected by:Elliot Silverstein\nCast:Richard Harris, Judith Anderson, Jean Gascon, Manu Tupou, Corinna Tsopei, Dub Taylor, James Gammon, William Jordan\nLeng : 111 minutes\nYear:1970\nLanguage (audio):Dolby Digital 5.1: English .
