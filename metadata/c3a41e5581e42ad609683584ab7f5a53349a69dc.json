His campy, theatrical appearance and performances often disguised his prodigious talent.\n\nLiberace was a child prodigy born to a musical family. His father, Salvatore, played French horn in John Philip Sousa's Concert Band, as well as the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. Instead of following in his father's footsteps and playing horn, Wladziu Liberace decided to play piano instead. Liberace was exceptionally gifted at piano, earning strong words of praise from Ignace Paderewski, which helped him land a scholarship at the Wisconsin College of Music at the age of seven; he retained his scholarship for 17 years, the longest period of time in the history of the academy. When he was 11, he debuted as a concert soloist. When he was in his teens, he was performing with symphony orchestras.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac Perfect (Lossless) \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:\t\t\tMCA\t\nCatalog:\t\tMCAD 22021\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Around The World (In Eighty Days)\n02.Fascination\n03.Love Is A Many Splendored Thing\n04.Moon River\n05.Greensleeves\n06.Love Letters\n07.Over The Rainbow\n08.You Belong To Me\n09.As Time Goes By\n10.I'm In The Mood For Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a41e5581e42ad609683584ab7f5a53349a69dc","amp;dn":"Liberace+-+Love+Letters+%281990%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a41e5581e42ad609683584ab7f5a53349a69dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,164,30,85,129,228,42,214,9,104,53,132,171,127,90,83,52,154,105,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
