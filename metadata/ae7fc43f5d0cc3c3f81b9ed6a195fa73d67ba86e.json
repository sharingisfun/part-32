X-COM: TFTD applies the same formula that made its predecesor such masterpiece; expect more tactical combat agains alien invaders, this time underwater.\n\nX-COM: TFTD was first released for MS-DOS in 1995. A PSX port followed in 1996.\n\nThis version in particular is the one included X-COM Collector's Edition (1998). It's a multi4 european version, you can choose English, French, German or Spanish.\n\nIt includes two sets of executables, the old MS-DOS set and a new Windows 95 set.\n\nMy suggestion is that you try the Windows 95 method first, because, as a general rule, a native executable is better than an emulator.\nX-COM Terror From The Deep for Windows 95\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n-Create the folder that will contain the game (Ej. C:gamesxcomtfd)\n-Decompress &quot;X-COM Terror From The Deep.7z&quot; to the previous folder. You'll need 7-zip for this task. Get it from http://7-zip.org/\n-Double-click on &quot;Terror From the Deep_patched.exe&quot; to run the game. If that one doesn't work for you, try &quot;Terror from the Deep.exe&quot;. If that one doesn't work either, read the next section.\n\nX-COM Terror From The Deep for MS-DOS\n\nIf, for some reason, the Windows 95 executables don't work on your system, you'll have to go the DosBox way.\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n-Create the folder that will contain the game (Ej. C:gamesxcomtfd)\n-Decompress &quot;X-COM Terror From The Deep.7z&quot; to the previous folder. You'll need 7-zip for this task. Get it from http://7-zip.org/\n-Download and install DosBox.\n\nThe most confortable option to run the game is to create a shortcut to DosBox that passes the location of the game's executable as an argument, &quot;c:gamesxcomtfdTERROR.BAT&quot; in this case. What I'm asking you to do is Windows general culture, but if you don't know what I'm talking about, read this excellent tutorial.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n2010/10/06, trapacer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7fc43f5d0cc3c3f81b9ed6a195fa73d67ba86e","amp;dn":"%5BPC%5D+X-COM+Terror+From+The+Deep+%5Bby+trapacer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7fc43f5d0cc3c3f81b9ed6a195fa73d67ba86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,127,196,63,93,12,195,195,248,27,158,214,161,149,250,115,214,123,168,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
