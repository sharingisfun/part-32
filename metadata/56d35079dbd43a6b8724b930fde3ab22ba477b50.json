Sure, there are DJ types whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been smashing bytes together for generations and a handful of enterprising indie acts whose laptronica bridged the gap between the digital and the meat world with varying degrees of success, but for the most part, bands who play instruments havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been quite as comfortable with the world of programming.\n\nThe Firebird Band joins the ranks of a rare few artists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most notably Blusom and Joan of Arc Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that are over electronic musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novelty. With The City at Night, the band blends its organic and electronic parts so seamlessly that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s downright impossible to separate the two anywhere in the mix. Where everyone from your friendly neighborhood industrial act to electroclash and dance-punk hipsters have thrown guitars on a lumpy mattress of big beats, samples and weird noises, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been an uncomfortable union: HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the rock, hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the techno Ã¢â‚¬â€œ make sure they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mix.\n\nThe Firebird Band gets the metaphorical peanut butter and chocolate all mixed up on The City at Night with vast soundscapes where atmospheric electronics loom large in the background while processed noises and tweaked guitar sounds play with voices and traditional guitars without making a fuss over it. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are so blended, layered and atmospheric, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly impossible to separate any individual elements from the song as a whole, not because of poor production, but simply because The City at NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are so tightly crafted everything must be taken on its own.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Obsessive CompulsionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ opens the album with synthetic squeaks and squawks, and then forceful beats and singer Christopher BroachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staccato delivery quickly join it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mix of gritty, here-and-now songwriting and introspective programming that splits the difference between Kid A and Danse Macabre. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Los Angeles,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Firebird Band opts to concentrate more upon atmosphere, as a wall of distorted, tricked-up guitars provide little more than noise-pollution atmosphere that fogs dance-floor beats and BroachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadpan delivery, only to break into minimalist chunks of spooky programming. Ã¢â‚¬Å“TokyoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sets aside much of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s programming for a song thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essentially just voice and piano, with murky atmospheric bits making the minimal arrangement all the more haunting.\n\nThe City at Night is an album thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more about atmospheres and mood than song-based indietronica acts. Then again, it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nearly as textured and atmospheric as albums by Radiohead or Blusom, acts infatuated by a ProTools rig. The Firebird Band definitely knows its way around a virtual mixing board, however, which makes its venture into elecro-rock an interesting one, even if it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t toe the dance-punk or post-rock lines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d35079dbd43a6b8724b930fde3ab22ba477b50","amp;dn":"The+Firebird+Band+-+The+City+at+Night+%282004%29+%5BV0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d35079dbd43a6b8724b930fde3ab22ba477b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,211,80,121,219,212,58,107,135,36,185,48,253,227,171,34,186,71,123,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
