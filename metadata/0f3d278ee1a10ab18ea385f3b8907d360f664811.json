In addition, two key deployment technologies are part of the JRE: Java Plug-in, which enables applets to run in popular browsers; and Java Web Start, which deploys standalone applications over a network. Users should install the 32-bit version if they are using 32-bit browsers. If you use both 32-bit and 64-bit browser interchangeably, you need a Java Plug-in for each browser. Hence you will need to install both 32-bit and 64-bit Java respectively.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3d278ee1a10ab18ea385f3b8907d360f664811","amp;dn":"Java+Runtime+Environment+7+Update+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3d278ee1a10ab18ea385f3b8907d360f664811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,61,39,142,225,161,10,177,142,163,133,243,184,144,125,54,15,102,72,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
