Recorded in May 1978 it consisted of eleven tracks, however the band was disappointed by the post-production done by RCA producers and the album was scrapped. The album circulated on bootlegs bearing the same title until it was commercially released in 1994 (along with a number of other tracks). The original track listing included all four tracks from An Ideal for Living EP. The commercial release included the original Warsaw album plus &quot;As You Said&quot; which was recorded and released in 1980 on the &quot;Komakino&quot; single, as well as the band's first recorded music, &quot;The Warsaw Demo&quot;, songs from which were noted as 'bonus tracks'. Incidentally, Bernard Sumner sings the chorus in this album's version of &quot;They Walked In Line&quot;.\n\nThis is the November 2012 Analog Loyalist remaster of the 1989 Bootleg CD [RZM JD 01]. Legend has it that RZM is code for (Alan) Erasmus, an original Factory partner who, with Tony Wilson and Peter Saville, started Factory Records in 1978.  The legend states that Erasmus (say it aloud, and then say R-Z-M) arranged the 1981 bootleg release of the aborted 1978 album, and then further arranged for the material's first appearance on CD in 1989.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zEEc1RC.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zEEc1RC.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae1a6615ee6de64ac7416f9c71f558f3fd03a982","amp;dn":"Warsaw+%5B2012%5D+%5BANALOG+LOYALIST+REMASTER%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae1a6615ee6de64ac7416f9c71f558f3fd03a982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,26,102,21,238,109,230,74,199,65,111,156,113,245,88,243,253,3,169,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
