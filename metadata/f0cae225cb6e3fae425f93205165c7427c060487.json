I bought it in 1966 in Yosemite Valley, having spent the summer working at the high camps. I've returned to it time &amp; time again in the almost 50 years since. The photography and the words never cease to capture and describe feelings deep within our hearts. This is one of my favorite passages; I've used it time &amp; again to comfort &amp; console:\n\nOur lives like dreams endure\nand reach out over the universe.\nNothing real is to itself alone.\nThere are sidestreams to rivers; there are overtones to thought.\nGreat love reaches out\nand is involved in the world's purposes.\n\nOur loves are only symbols of an unknown immortality.\nWhere communion is deep, there exists no separation at all,\nfor what needs telling those we love is understood already,\nand what is supposed to be gone and past\nis often more real than ever.\nThrough the sculpture of experience,\nthat part of ourselves which survives,\nlike cloud, resolves continuously.\nThis is the spirit of my hope and my religion.\n\n- Cedric Wright, Words of the Earth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0cae225cb6e3fae425f93205165c7427c060487","amp;dn":"Words+of+the+Earth+%28Photo+Poetry+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0cae225cb6e3fae425f93205165c7427c060487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,202,226,37,203,110,63,174,66,95,147,32,81,101,199,66,124,6,4,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
