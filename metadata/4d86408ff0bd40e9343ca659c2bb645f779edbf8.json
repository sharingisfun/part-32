The glory of St Athanasius is that he did not move with the times; it is his reward that he now remains when those times, like all others, have passed away. &quot;When I first opened De Incarnatione I soon discovered by a very simple test that I was reading a masterpiece, for only a mastermind could have written so deeply on such a subject with such classical simplicity&quot; -- C.
