Their music is a combination of rock, psychedelia, and metal.\n\nDuring the nineties the band focused mainly on psychedelic music although they incorporated a wide range of styles of electronic music, from trance, krautrock and ambient due to Steven Wilson and Richard Barbieri&amp;#039;s liking for the Kosmische Musik scene of the early 70&amp;#039;s, led by bands such as Tangerine Dream, Neu! and Can to more recently metal. For live shows, Porcupine Tree make use of a screen that displays a different projection for each song. This visual element was introduced during the In Absentia tour, when the band started to work with Danish photographer and film-maker Lasse Hoile, whose works finished to create a distinctive image for the band.\n\nDespite being signed to Roadrunner in Europe and Atlantic in the U.S., the band have their own record label, Transmission, which they use to launch some independent releases and special limited editions of their albums. Porcupine Tree have an official online store on Burning Shed (also home for OSI, Chroma Key and Roger Eno among others), now the official online distributor to legendary label Peaceville Records, and to Kscope (both Snapper Music divisions).\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bde0d3d38da56df37ffebc508e74a2f635ae5ed","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree+-+1991+-+1997+-+Stars+Die+-+The+Deleriun+Years+%5BA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bde0d3d38da56df37ffebc508e74a2f635ae5ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,222,13,61,56,218,86,223,55,255,235,197,8,231,74,47,99,90,229,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
