Starting with just a loincloth, you must explore the wilderness to find water, food, and shelter. Battle the elements and wild animals in your struggle for survival. Gather resources to make tools and weapons. Find a nice little cave near a waterhole and some berry bushes, and you could be on the way to living large - Caveman style! Caveman is an open ended role playing game / simulator. The object is to survive and become as powerful as possible. There is no time limit. There is no specific quest, adventure, mission, or campaign you must complete to win the game. There are quests but they are optional, simply another means of surviving. Basically, as long as your caveman is alive, you're winning the game. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the RAR are instructions for installation as well as a shareware copy of the game and a patch to unlock the full version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7cc71941208a0db613817dcd341d28bd3b1247a","amp;dn":"Caveman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7cc71941208a0db613817dcd341d28bd3b1247a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,204,113,148,18,8,160,219,97,56,23,220,211,65,210,139,211,177,36,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
