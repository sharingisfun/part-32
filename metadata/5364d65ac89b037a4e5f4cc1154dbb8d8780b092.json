It's use is broad- everything from &quot;epic orchestral&quot; to concert band music and more. This particular set has been deep-sampled to provide excellent playability and reasonably good sound quality, certainly good enough for any project. There is a very large dynamic range on the instrument, allowing it to ring out above the orchestra as it truly would, or sink behind quietly to just accent the flow of the piece. The chimes' delays were recorded up to 10 seconds; pressing down the sustain pedal will unleash the full resonance of the chimes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5364d65ac89b037a4e5f4cc1154dbb8d8780b092","amp;dn":"Versilian+Studio+-+Tubular+Bells+1.0+VSTi+x86+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5364d65ac89b037a4e5f4cc1154dbb8d8780b092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,100,214,90,200,155,3,122,78,95,76,193,21,77,187,141,135,128,176,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
