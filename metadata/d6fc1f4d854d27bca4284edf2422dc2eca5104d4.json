The intention is to develop this book as a textbook for graduate students, as it includes design guidelines for engineers and references for researchers. It is hoped that this book may also be used to aid the design of offshore structures as it details applied mechanics and design/engineering. The book has been used in a teaching course for M.Sc. students at Stavanger University College and IBC training course for engineers in pipeline and riser industries since August 1998. Its preparation was motivated by recent developments in research and engineering and new design codes. It aims to educate more pipeline engineers and provide materials for on-job training on the use of new design codes and guides","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6fc1f4d854d27bca4284edf2422dc2eca5104d4","amp;dn":"Pipelines+and+Risers+%28Elsevier+Ocean+Engineering+Book+Series+Vol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6fc1f4d854d27bca4284edf2422dc2eca5104d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,252,31,77,133,77,39,188,164,40,78,223,36,34,220,46,202,81,4,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
