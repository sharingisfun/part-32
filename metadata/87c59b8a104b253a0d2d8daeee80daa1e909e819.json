This solution is not based on politics, morality, laws, or any other &quot;establishment&quot; notions of human affairs, but rather on a modern, non-superstitious based understanding of what we are and how we align with nature, to which we are a part. The work advocates a new social system which is updated to present day knowledge, highly influenced by the life long work of Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project.\n\nSize.........: 1.37 GiB\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nFrame Size...: 852x480\nBit rate.....: 1451 Kbps\nFPS..........: 23.976\nAudio........: MP3, 128 Kbps, 1 channel, CBR\nPlayTime.....: 2h 3mn\nRipped by....: SectoR &amp; RiMMER\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c59b8a104b253a0d2d8daeee80daa1e909e819","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist.Addendum.HQ.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c59b8a104b253a0d2d8daeee80daa1e909e819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,197,155,138,16,75,37,58,13,45,141,174,238,128,218,161,233,9,232,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
