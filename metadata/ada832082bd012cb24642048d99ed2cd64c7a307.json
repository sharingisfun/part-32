EHV AC Undergrounding Electrical Power discusses new methods of analysis for cable performance and for the network behaviour of cable, mixed and overhead lines. It uses capability charts throughout, to offer the reader a clear visual representation of transmission line performances.\n\nThe authors discuss the technically computed undergrounding of electrical power and develop original procedures based on the classical equations of transmission lines. They also provide technical and economical comparisons of a variety of cables and analysis methods, in order to examine the performance of AC power transmission systems. A range of important topics are covered, including:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ energization and de-energization phenomena of transmission lines;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ power quality; and\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ cable safety constraints.\n\nEHV AC Undergrounding Electrical Power is an original guide on cable insertion planning and the operation of power networks. It will enable readers to make detailed performance comparisons between power transmission systems, which will be valuable for postgraduates, as well as engineers involved in power cable manufacturing or electrical transmission systems.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 189 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (May 4, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1848828667\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1848828667","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada832082bd012cb24642048d99ed2cd64c7a307","amp;dn":"EHV+AC+Undergrounding+Electrical+Power+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ada832082bd012cb24642048d99ed2cd64c7a307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,168,50,8,43,208,18,203,36,100,32,72,217,158,210,205,100,199,163,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
