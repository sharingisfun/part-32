Mastered by Carl Rosamond at RRS Music. This is a musical journey into the unconscious where your thoughts and fears seem to multiply and mutate into a hideous beast intent on waking you with a start. Every song is loosely based around a dream or nightmare endured by the band. Songs about the distortion of reality that are dreams and things that go bump in the night. Ever woken to find yourself transformed into a gigantic beetle? Or a coconut crab?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614476f784905da4d3b8115e3912f1e3a315b59f","amp;dn":"The+Scaramanga+Six+-+The+Terrifying+Dream+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614476f784905da4d3b8115e3912f1e3a315b59f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,68,118,247,132,144,93,164,211,184,17,94,57,18,241,227,163,21,181,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
