But, although his\nown fear means that his initial treatment of Friday is harsh and cruel, the\nenslavement of a fellow human being enables Crusoe to see how depraving and\ncorrupting such vile practices are, and eventually he and Friday become friends\nand comrades, but only when Crusoe realises he must give Friday total and\nunconditional freedom.\n\nThe film contains some of Bunuel&amp;#039;s most potent cinema: the feverish dream\nsequence where Crusoe&amp;#039;s father chides him for his adventurous, and, therefore,\n&quot;wayward&quot; spirit; the scene where he is so desperate to hear another human voice\nhe goes to the Valley of the Echo and shouts a Psalm, and then walks in despair\ninto the sea until his torch is extinguished by the waves; and the final scene\nwhere, leaving the island at last with Friday, he looks back for the last time,\nand hears the ghostly echo of his faithful, but long since dead dog Rex barking.\n\nShot in PathÃƒÂ©color, some of the scenes are beautiful, whilst others could be\nimproved upon, but the sheer drama and intellectual engagement it provides\novercome such minor technical faults, and the whole is wonderfully enhanced by\na first-rate score by Anthony Collins and Luis Breton. Dan O&amp;#039;Herlihy as Crusoe\ncarries the entire film, and was quite rightly nominated as &quot;Best Actor&quot; for\nthis role at the 1954 Academy Awards. It is perhaps Bunuel at his most laid-back\nand subtle, but, believe me, watched in the right frame of mind, (which means\nforgetting all your preconceptions about the well-known story), it packs as much\npunch as any of his films. A rare and beautiful gem well-worth searching out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b8790f64a70e97b610ee369bd386ca081211502","amp;dn":"Robinson+Crusoe+1954+ENG+ESP+Honeyko+100%25+XviD+Restored","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b8790f64a70e97b610ee369bd386ca081211502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,135,144,246,74,112,233,123,97,14,227,105,189,56,108,160,129,33,21,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
