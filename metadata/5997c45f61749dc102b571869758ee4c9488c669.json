With the aim of delivering nothing less than a worthy successor to SAVAGE GRACE's &quot;Master Of Disguise&quot; album from 1985, they put together songs with the feeling and the intensity of US metal in its prime.\n\nWith a vocalist who delivers it all (Alexx Stahl), a rhythm section to break bones (Jens Gellner &amp; Mario Lang) and two lead guitars with that certain &quot;savoir faire&quot; (Kalli Coldsmith &amp; Wolfgang Buchinger), MASTERS OF DISGUISE hit the stages in Fall 2013 with their debut album &quot;BACK WITH A VENGEANCE&quot;.\nNow the second album is finished and Knutson is on his way up north to Limb Music, providing them with everything they need to release the successor to this highly acclaimed and successful debut!\n\n\nMASTERS OF DISGUISE do NOT copy the legendary past of that Speed Metal legend SAVAGE GRACE - they fill the musical gap SAVAGE GRACE have left and they do this with panache and incredible self-confidence!\n\nMASTERS OF DISGUISE are a furious explosion of speed and power and top it off with a high proportion of melody.\n\n\nWatch out, because Knutson has returned again...\n\n1. \tJudgement Day \t02:13 \t  instrumental\n2. \tThe Enforcer \t03:39 \t \n3. \tConquering the World \t06:26 \t \n4. \tKnutson II: (Only a Mother's) Love Is Forever \t05:59 \t \n5. \tHeavens Fall \t04:29 \t \n6. \tNew Horizons \t06:57 \t \n7. \tSins of the Damned (Savage Grace cover) \t04:07 \t \n8. \tThe Scavenger's Daughter \t03:43 \t \n9. \tBarbarians of the Gate \t03:33 \t \n10. \tWar of the Gods (Part I) \t06:46 \t \n11. \tHammerhead (Flotsam &amp; Jetsam cover) \t06:01 \t \n  \t53:53 \t \n\nMario Lang \tBass\nKalli Coldsmith \tGuitars\nAlexx Stahl \tVocals\nJens Gellner \tDrums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5997c45f61749dc102b571869758ee4c9488c669","amp;dn":"Masters+Of+Disguise+-+The+Savage+And+The+Grace+%5B2015%5D+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5997c45f61749dc102b571869758ee4c9488c669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,151,196,95,97,116,157,193,2,181,113,134,151,88,238,76,148,136,198,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
