Released in 2003, the single peaked at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Aguilera&amp;#039;s 11th Top 40 hit. The single also peaked at #9 in the UK and #19 in Australia. The single is most known for its simplistic, but critically acclaimed music video that was filmed in black and white as a single continuous camera shot. The video was nominated for three 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Female Video, Viewer&amp;#039;s Choice, and Best Cinematography. For reasons unknown, the song was only included as a bonus track for Aguilera&amp;#039;s greatest hits album Keeps Gettin&amp;#039; Better ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A Decade of Hits, despite placing higher on the US Hot 100 than &quot;Dirrty&quot;, which is included.\n\nThe song&amp;#039;s music video was directed by David LaChapelle. It opens with a close-up of Aguilera and zooms out to her wearing a slip and sitting in an abandoned prop room. In one continuous black-and-white shot, Aguilera walks through several rooms, exits the building, and finally lays on a light box. The video was filmed at a deserted theater in downtown Los Angeles, California. It is inspired by neorealist works.\n\n&quot;The Voice Within&amp;#039;&quot; was the eleventh video for Aguilera to appear on TRL. The video hit number one twice and spent thirty-seven days on the countdown.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb4ad6d7478447bc38b49487c34a1f27dd86ec60","amp;dn":"Christina+Aguilera+-+The+Voice+Within","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb4ad6d7478447bc38b49487c34a1f27dd86ec60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,74,214,215,71,132,71,188,56,180,148,135,195,74,31,39,221,134,236,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
