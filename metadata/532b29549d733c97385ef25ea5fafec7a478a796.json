Filled to capacity with 16 songs, this collection is about as complete as one can hope for in a single volume. \n\nIt starts out with early classic rock radio staples like &quot;Black Magic Woman,&quot; &quot;Evil Ways,&quot; &quot;Oye Como Va,&quot; and the cover of the Zombies &quot;She's not There.&quot; The disc then moves on to more recent Santana hits like the new wave-ish &quot;Winning,&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; before returning to the early days for some excellent lengthy jams like &quot;Dance Sister Dance&quot; and &quot;Soul Scrifice.&quot; \nThe only thing missing is any material from Santana's recent commercial comeback. The disc gets extra credit for not adding on any inferior &quot;new&quot; material like a lot of such packages do.\n\nOverall, an excellent one volume anthology from one of classic rock's brighter stars.
