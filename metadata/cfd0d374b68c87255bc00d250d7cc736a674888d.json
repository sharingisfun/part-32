Unable to interact with a fragile world that isn't built to withstand your size? To live in a house that doesn't fit you anymore - with a wife who doesn't either? Craig Pressgang's life is well documented in his official CIA biography, &quot;Giant Man: Pillar of America,&quot; but the heroic picture it paints is only half the story. The continuous growth caused by Craig's strange medical condition brings a variety of problems as he becomes more isolated and unknowable. Told in three eras by three women with unique relationships with Craig, 3 Story follows his sad life from his birth to the present. Harvey Award winner Matt Kindt (Super Spy, Pistolwhip) brings his innovative design and storytelling sensibility to this poignant look at what it really means to be different, alienated from the rest of the world.\n\nOther work by Matt Kindt...\n\nPistolwhip &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7640332/Matt_Kindt_-_Pistolwhip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7640332/Matt_Kindt_-_Pistolwhip&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2 Sisters - A Super-Spy Graphic Novel &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7640344/Matt_Kindt_-_2_Sisters_-_A_Super-Spy_Graphic_Novel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7640344/Matt_Kindt_-_2_Sisters_-_A_Super-Spy_Graphic_Novel&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd0d374b68c87255bc00d250d7cc736a674888d","amp;dn":"Matt+Kindt+-+3+Story+-+The+Secret+History+of+the+Giant+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd0d374b68c87255bc00d250d7cc736a674888d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,208,211,116,182,140,135,37,91,192,13,37,13,124,199,54,166,116,136,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
