Rescued after a hurricane in South America, doomed to a life of poverty with a swallow medal as her only legacy, the orphaned toddler was adopted by an American family and taken to a new life. As a beautiful, intelligent woman of nineteen, she is in love, engaged, and excited about the future Ã¢â‚¬â€ until another traumatic event shatters her dreams. Menina flees to Spain to bury her misery in research for her college thesis about a sixteenth-century artist who signed his works with the image of a swallow Ã¢â‚¬â€ the same image as the one on MeninaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medal. But a mugging strands Menina in a musty, isolated Spanish convent. Exploring her surroundings, she discovers the epic sagas of five orphan girls who were hidden from the Spanish Inquisition and received help escaping to the New World. Is MeninaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medal a link to them, or to her own past? Did coincidence lead her to the convent, or fate? Both love story and historical thriller, The Sisterhood is an emotionally charged ride across continents and centuries.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d10ebfc99f674104e3ba23d593094badc7ff50f","amp;dn":"The+Sisterhood+by+Helen+Bryan+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d10ebfc99f674104e3ba23d593094badc7ff50f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,16,235,252,153,246,116,16,78,59,162,61,89,48,148,186,220,127,245,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
