With only six years left until the mysterious crystalline structure Tiberium renders the earth entirely uninhabitable, the two opposing factions -- Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod -- inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind. The unthinkable becomes reality and Nod's enigmatic leader Kane takes off for GDI headquarters. What is Kane planning in the heart of his enemies' base?\n\nIn addition to the two campaigns on the epic battles of GDI and Nod, which players will get to conquer alone or in a cooperative mode, Command &amp; Conquer 4 also features a new 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode, promoting teamwork and cooperation and delivering a social real-time-strategy experience never seen before in a Command &amp; Conquer game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5a9025b2226e76450d9a8e0d071f250c99792e","amp;dn":"Command+%26+Conquer+4%3A+Tiberian+Twilight+%5BPC%5D+%5BRETAIL%5D+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5a9025b2226e76450d9a8e0d071f250c99792e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,90,144,37,178,34,110,118,69,13,154,142,13,7,31,37,12,153,121,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
