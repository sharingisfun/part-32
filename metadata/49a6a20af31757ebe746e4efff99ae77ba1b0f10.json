Jonah Gersten, MD, a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, clearly adored her. He was handsome, successful, and a doting dad to their four-year-old triplets. But when Jonah is found dead in the Upper East Side apartment of second-rate Ã¢â‚¬Å“escortÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dorinda Dillon, Susie is overwhelmed with questions left unanswered. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bad enough to know your husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been murdered, but even worse when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re universally pitied (and quietly mocked) because of the sleaze factor. None of it makes sense to SusieÃ¢â‚¬â€not a sexual liaison with someone like Dorinda, not the Ã¢â‚¬Å“better not to discuss itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ response from JonahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partners. With help from her tough-talking, high-style grandma Ethel, who flies in from Miami, she takes on her snooty in-laws, her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partners, the NYPD, and the DA as she tries to prove that her wonderful life with Jonah was no lie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a6a20af31757ebe746e4efff99ae77ba1b0f10","amp;dn":"Susan+Isaacs+-+As+Husbands+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a6a20af31757ebe746e4efff99ae77ba1b0f10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,166,162,10,243,23,87,235,231,70,228,239,255,153,174,119,186,27,15,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
