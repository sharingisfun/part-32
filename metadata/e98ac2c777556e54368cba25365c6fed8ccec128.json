Sewell is back and melding\nfurther with his own funky blues-based playing on Artist in Residence, which is\na far-reaching jazz record combining elements of post-bop, New Orleans jazz,\nfunk, blues and even post-20th century classical music to Moran's array of\nshades and colors to play with. The repetitive sampled spoken word loop by\nAdrian Piper which acts as the ground for both the opener &quot;Break Down&quot; and\n&quot;Artists Ought To Be Writing&quot; is a bit h jarring when the band lights up under\nher. As she chants &quot;Break down the barriers/Break down, misunderstanding/Break\ndown, the artworld/Break down, the artist/Break down, the general public . .,&quot;\nthe band uses it (looped continually through the piece, even in the solos) to\nground everything in a circular rhythmic principle. Just as unsettling is Alicia\nHall Moran's soprano vocal in near Webern-like lieder as the introduction to\n&quot;Milestone&quot; atop Moran's lilting piano before the band kicks it in prosaically\nat the one-minute mark. She frames her wordless vocal just as Moran's left hand\nbegins to spin out a melodic figure for everyone else to play around, though the\nentire piece sounds like an intro. Bassist Tarus Mateen and drummer Nasheet\nWaits earn their keep trying to ground this piece as it spirals to near and far\nEastern shores. But it gets so much stranger as the improvised bass intro to\n&quot;Refraction 2&quot; begins to introduce the players almost sideways, and where melody\nand harmony appear almost as if by accident. Yet it's all motion, building,\nfalling, spilling, and being contained within a harmonic grid that is nearly\nwide open. The breakdown theme restates itself only to become more fleshed-out\nas narrative essay in &quot;Artists Ought to Be Writing,&quot; but the solo piano that\nfollows is so speculative it never really takes off. The long-ish improvised\nintro that finally gels as &quot;Rain&quot; is the album's most exciting tune. From its\ncryptic, elliptical movement into a full-fledged angular yet funky post-bop\ntune, it is breaking apart by its end nearly 12 minutes later. People may\ninitially have a hard time with Artist in Residence. But it moves so freely and\nyet so purposely that it draws the listener into its unique soundworld slowly\nbut deliberately, and offers plenty for the effort.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98ac2c777556e54368cba25365c6fed8ccec128","amp;dn":"Jason+Moran+-+Artist+In+Residence+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98ac2c777556e54368cba25365c6fed8ccec128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,138,194,199,119,85,110,84,54,140,186,37,54,92,111,237,140,206,193,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
