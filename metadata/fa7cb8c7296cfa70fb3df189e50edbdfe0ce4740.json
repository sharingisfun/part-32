Written, produced and with vocals from dan himself, the album features collaborations with Emmy The Great, Merz, Sarah Williams White, B Dolan, Joshua Idehen and Pete Hefferan.\nDan le SacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation for vibrant good times at festivals and club nights is unarguable, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also proved with Ã¢â‚¬ËœSpace Between The WordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot more than simply the bloke behind the bloke with the big beard. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a musical force to be reckoned with and in Ã¢â‚¬ËœSpace Between The WordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, an album dan le Sac has created a smart, zingy debut shot that will appeal to fans of indie, dance, hip hop, electronica and much else besides. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one to file alongside Metronomy, Hot Chip and Field Music as a sharply individual snapshot of modern popÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endless possibilities.\n\n\nAll my torrents are tagged, with cover art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7cb8c7296cfa70fb3df189e50edbdfe0ce4740","amp;dn":"Dan+Le+Sac+-+Space+Between+The+Words+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7cb8c7296cfa70fb3df189e50edbdfe0ce4740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,124,184,199,41,108,250,112,251,61,241,137,229,14,219,223,224,206,71,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
