However, Richards proved too tough for Blade's thugs. Unfortunately, they managed to swipe the manuscript for his next book, which included instructions on how to commit the perfect murder. Blade has his thugs follow those instructions to kill Richards, but Richards was able to anticipate them  (seeing as how he wrote the book and all), so he managed to avoid death without the gangsters realizing it. Now that Blade's thugs were no longer looking for him, Kendall assumed the guise of Bogey Man and brought them to justice.\n\n\n\nRed Band Comics #1-4 (covers only for #3-4)\nZoom Comics #[nn]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b26ed9d3cc19ff5de49a7f9457b32bc228a559","amp;dn":"The+Bogey+Man+collection+COMPLETE++1945+Rural","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b26ed9d3cc19ff5de49a7f9457b32bc228a559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,178,110,217,211,204,25,255,93,228,154,127,148,87,179,43,194,40,165,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
