Then it's her home-style version of Jamaica's classic jerk chicken with coconutty rice and peas. And she is shaking up an all-time favourite salad, turning the left-over jerk chicken into a quick chick Caesar. Then toad in the hole gets a face-lift for a cosy and cocooning Sunday night supper.\n\nThis is the food Nigella loves, and she did it her way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd5933fe2c3640d31cfd83c39bf7e40c61ff343","amp;dn":"Nigella.Kitchen.S01E11.9Dec2010.PDTV.XviD-WTB.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd5933fe2c3640d31cfd83c39bf7e40c61ff343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,213,147,63,226,195,100,13,49,207,216,60,57,191,126,64,198,31,243,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
