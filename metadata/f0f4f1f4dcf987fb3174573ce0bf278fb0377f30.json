These are all 200 dpi and regular single pages run about 1600 pixels wide.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f4f1f4dcf987fb3174573ce0bf278fb0377f30","amp;dn":"MAD+423+-+MAD+Magazine+50th+Anniversary+-+Real+scans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f4f1f4dcf987fb3174573ce0bf278fb0377f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,244,241,244,220,249,135,251,49,116,87,60,224,191,39,143,176,55,127,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
