This wide range of disciplines is one of the fascinations of the helicopter, but it is also makes a complete understanding difficult.\n\nThose searching for an understanding of the helicopter will find The Art of the Helicopter invaluable. John Watkinson approaches every subject associated with the helicopter from first principles and builds up in a clearly explained logical sequence using plain English and clear diagrams, avoiding unnecessary mathematics.\n\nTechnical terms and buzzwords are defined and acronyms are spelled out. Misnomers, myths and old wives tales (for there are plenty surrounding helicopters) are disposed of. Whilst the contents of the book are expressed in straightforward language there is no oversimplification and the content is based on established physics and accepted theory. The student of helicopter technology or aerodynamics will find here a concise introduction leading naturally to more advanced textbooks on the subject.\n\n* Designed to complement the instruction of PPL(H) flying training in order to assist helicopter pilots in-training to achieve their &quot;wings&quot;.\n* Clear and simple diagrams aid verbal explanations to provide an easy to understand account of how helicopters are made, how they fly and how to fly them.\n* The only book to cover all the aspects of helicopter design, manufacture and performance in one volume.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd30e3e0a2aadccdf0c28ac7f0e6c216b644986e","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Art+of+the+Helicopter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd30e3e0a2aadccdf0c28ac7f0e6c216b644986e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,48,227,224,162,170,220,205,240,194,138,199,240,230,194,22,182,68,152,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
