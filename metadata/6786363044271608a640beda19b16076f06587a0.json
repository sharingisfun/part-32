Since then, it has become a secret weapon of major artists and producers such as Steve Stevens, Vernon Reid, Devildriver, and Ill NiÃƒÂ±o.\n\nIn 2011, Recabinet 3 was released as an audio FX plugin for VST, AU, and RTAS formats for Mac OS X and Windows. It offers 20 virtual cabinets, 8 virtual mics, and 2 internal channels with the British-inspired Kazrog Konsole EQ, specifically voiced for making guitar and bass tracks come alive. Best of all, you can blend any cabinet and microphone/position combination with 100% phase coherency Ã¢â‚¬â€œ breaking the laws of physics!\n\nIn version 3.1.1, Recabinet added Speaker Dynamics modeling, simulating all of the nonlinear behavior of real guitar speakers. This feature has made Recabinet by far the most accurate speaker cabinet simulator in the industry. Recabinet 3.5 adds third party IR import and stereo panning, adding infinite flexibility to Recabinet.\n\nRecabinet 3 makes it fast and easy to find inspiring new sounds, avoiding the hassle of complex mixer routing and folder navigation associated with impulse response libraries. It also ships with ready-to-rock factory presets, with more on the way from major artists and producers.\n\nAdd Recabinet 3 in the signal chain after your favorite analog guitar amp, or your favorite software amp simulator (with cabinet simulation disabled) and you will experience a dramatic improvement in the realism of your guitar tracks. Recabinet 3 changes the proverbial game, giving you album-quality guitar tone direct, faster and easier than ever before.\n\nProduct Details\n\nCabinets:\n\n    1960 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Marshall 1960AV 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Angora Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Line 6 Vetta 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Blackface 4Ãƒâ€”10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Fender Ã¢â‚¬â„¢65 Super Reverb 4Ãƒâ€”10\n    Chordal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Roland JC120\n    Damien Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Marshall 1936 2Ãƒâ€”12\n    Dazed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Supro Thunderbolt\n    Eagle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an ENGL Pro 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Excel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Randall RS412XLT100 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Genzie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Genz Benz G-Flex ported 2Ãƒâ€”12\n    Green Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an original 1970s Marshall 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Igor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Krank Krankenstein 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Manatee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an Ampeg SVT 8Ãƒâ€”10\n    Motown Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an Ampeg Portaflex B15N\n    Ogre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Bogner Uberkab 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Oversize Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Mesa Standard 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Sterling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Marshall Hand Wired 4Ãƒâ€”12 (late 1960s reissue)\n    Tangerine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an Orange 4Ãƒâ€”12\n    Top Boost Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Vox AC30\n    Tweed 1Ãƒâ€”12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Fender Ã¢â‚¬â„¢53 Deluxe 1Ãƒâ€”12\n    Zodiac 2Ãƒâ€”12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Selmer Zodiac Twin 30\n\nMicrophones:\n\n    57 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Shure SM57\n    545 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Shure Unidyne III 545\n    121 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Royer 121\n    409 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Sennheiser MD409\n    421 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Sennheiser MD421\n    i5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an Audix i5\n    Reference Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on an Earthworks M30\n    U87 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on a Neumann U87\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6786363044271608a640beda19b16076f06587a0","amp;dn":"Kazrog+Recabinet+v3.5.0-R2R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6786363044271608a640beda19b16076f06587a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,134,54,48,68,39,22,8,166,64,190,218,25,177,96,118,240,101,135,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
