But after her grandmother passes away and it falls to her less-than-reliable father to take her instead, MegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-anticipated travel plans seem permanently on hold.\n\nWhen her dad finally tells Meg to book the trip, she prays that the experience will heal the fissures left on her life by her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ divorce. But when Meg arrives in Florence, her father is nowhere to be found, leaving aspiring memoir-writer Sophia Borelli to introduce Meg to the rich beauty of the ancient city. Sofia claims to be one of the last surviving members of the Medici family and that a long-ago Medici princess, Nora Orsini, communicates with her from within the great masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nWhen Sophia, Meg, and NoraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories intersect, their lives will be indelibly changed as they each answer the question: What if renaissance isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a word? What if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what happens when you dare to believe that what is isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what has to be?\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
