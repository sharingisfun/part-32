The second of a three-part upgrade to Eye Candy 4000, Nature offers beautifully rendered effects that any novice or professional designer will appreciate.\n\nNature includes four new filters and reincarnates six Eye Candy classics. The classic filters boast brand-new looks, greater realism, and improved ease-of-use. For example, select filters can create a new layer and render effects to it; this allows you to view, edit, or turn off these effects without modifying the original layer.\n\nNature includes over 500 presets for frequently used effects; you can find the perfect effect quickly. The improved settings management system makes it easy to browse, share and collect new settings.\nNature also works with 16-bit images. Color transitions are smoother, with less banding. Print documents reproduce colors more accurately.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87bb963651a98c20da70f2ebc854f7b304dd5ba6","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Eye+Candy+5+Nature+v5.1+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87bb963651a98c20da70f2ebc854f7b304dd5ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,187,150,54,81,169,140,32,218,112,242,235,200,84,247,179,4,221,91,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
