You are about to find out. It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be pretty. It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be dull. And surely, it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be safe. In fact, making just one wrong choice could put evil at your bedside watching you sleep.\nAnd so it is with Kate Simmons, a young woman who, by choosing to regain her life, actually puts it at risk by the very choices she makes. After unimaginable heartbreak stops her world on a dime, Kate falls into a three-year blackness of self blame that brings her to the edge of life, itself. As time finally brings light back through tiny cracks of renewed desire, Kate moves out of the prison she made for herself in her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home to find a new reality, rooming with her best girlfriend, Charlie. \nYet, to be free is to be vulnerable, and KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choices more than ever mark a splattered line between being happy and being dead. \nCare to choose? HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your menu: \nA strangely alluring building manager so possessed with wanting you for his own, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bury more than the fact he has a girlfriend; a buff college student for whom you are clearly hot, as are all the other girls on campus; a pushy lawyer who is as handsome as he is intoxicated with conquest, who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take no for an answer, who gets what he wants Ã¢â‚¬â€ always.\nSometimes, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whom you choose. Sometimes, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who chooses you. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Kate, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both, and it puts you on a perilous road where good looks and humor are the thin masks of jealous delusion and utter violence.\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in trouble when the sum total of your choices is written in blood red.\n\nTaken by You (The Killer Next Door #2)\nHow tragic it is when a caged spirit finally finds its freedom and Ã¢â‚¬â€ entranced in its ecstasy Ã¢â‚¬â€ is invited by that freedom into a cloaked dance with danger.\nIn Book One of this three-part epic, Kate Simmons Ã¢â‚¬â€ young and alluring, and finally out of her cage of grief Ã¢â‚¬â€ attracts more than attention. Intoxicated by her newfound independence, a blithe Kate is on her way to finding out that around the corners of life, some life-changing eye-openers await. As the story continues in Book Two and she begins to churn a dangerously turbulent trail, it is Kate who now has to snap to, to react, to outrun, or become yet another tortured victim who vanishes down the path of wrong choice.\nHaving already roiled the risky waters of jealousy, Kate moves in with Neil while Roger Ã¢â‚¬â€ an enamored oddity Ã¢â‚¬â€ visits his son in Germany. Upon his return and finding Kate gone, RogerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s predator mind becomes unhitched, and then unleashed, on the hunt of a lifetime. But whose life?\nStep by creeping step, even as KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future closes in on her, she attends Ã¢â‚¬â€ obliviously Ã¢â‚¬â€ to her new life, working through the challenges of fresh relationships, losing family members both to death and to deceit, questioning the depth of love. \nEvery path offers a choice. Every choice offers a consequence. And every consequence summons its due. As emotions swirl across fateful days and nights, some in KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life will reach out to touch happiness in warm embraces, others to sever ties in bloody traces.\nThe stains of passion are frequently mistaken. The question here is who will be taken?\n\nGiven to You (The Killer Next Door #3)\nTo give is a virtue. But to give your very self, the ultimate bequest. Offered in love, it can be wondrous. Offered in desperation, it can be deadly.\nIn Book Two of this three-part epic, young and tempting Kate Simmons at last seemed to have reached a safe haven of happiness when she moved in with Neil, ambitious and persevering, both in his legal practice and his love life. Taking great care to protect his trophy and the surprise he had in mind for Kate, Neil hired security to accompany his soon-to-be fiancÃƒÂ©e on a scavenger hunt of a lifetime. As Book Three continues their saga, it is life itself that is in the balance when Kate becomes the hunted as the jilted Roger snatches his prey.\nThe obsessed minds of Neil and Roger now take aim squarely at each other Ã¢â‚¬â€ with a bare and exposed Kate directly in the crossfire. Knowing her very life will be the winnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spoil, Kate stares agony in its ghastly face as it approaches for the death dance. \nThere is no time, no place, no safety in a war of fixation. A war in which the winner will be either the last one standing, or the last one to die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4a50f62c7db98f0a93d9e3ecee9c697ea950d2b","amp;dn":"The+Killer+Next+Door+Series+1-3+by+Carlie+Sexton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4a50f62c7db98f0a93d9e3ecee9c697ea950d2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,165,15,98,199,219,152,240,169,61,158,62,206,233,198,151,234,149,13,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
