It is Coldplay&amp;#039;s biggest hit, charting at number one in the U.K., the U.S., and Germany.\n\nThe official music video for &quot;Viva la Vida&quot; was directed by Hype Williams and premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨red at Coldplay&amp;#039;s official website on August 1. The video features the band performing in multi-colour backgrounds, including the album&amp;#039;s artwork (used for the majority of the video) and speeding clouds (used in between verses and in parts of the final chorus). The video ends with every band member crumbling to rose petals that fly into the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff51f65bc6c18c92b791b87bacaff3b91da54afd","amp;dn":"Coldplay+-+Viva+La+Vida","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff51f65bc6c18c92b791b87bacaff3b91da54afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,81,246,91,198,193,140,146,183,145,184,123,172,175,243,185,29,165,74,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
