A live concert never bootlegged and always referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“no recording existÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Well, we donÃ‚Â´care! Here it is! \n\nSetlist: Anarchy In the UK/I Wanna Be Me/Seventeen/New York/EMI/No Fun/Problems/No Feelings/God Save the Queen/Pretty Vacant.\n\nPhoto: John on stage at Barbarellas.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The band did two gigs in VÃƒÂ¤xjÃƒÂ¶, at the disco Barbarella's. The first night for 15 to 20 year olds, and the second night for people over 21. None of the gigs were recorded. The second set was slightly longer and included Submission and Liar that were not played the first night. They opened both nights with Anarchy In The UK / I Wanna Be Me / Seventeen as on all Scandinavian gigs. No Fun was played mid-set the 23rd and as an encore the 24th.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pacEnaAGk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pacEnaAGk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2abd30bc611f1ca9063fb9784bada5e1f53c0956","amp;dn":"Sex+Pistols+Barbarellas+V%26auml%3Bxj%26ouml%3B+Sweden+23+july+1977+BOOT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2abd30bc611f1ca9063fb9784bada5e1f53c0956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,189,48,188,97,31,28,169,6,63,185,120,75,173,165,225,245,60,9,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
