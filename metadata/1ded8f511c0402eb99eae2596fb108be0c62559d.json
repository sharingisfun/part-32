His boyfriend, Terry, says Ã¢â‚¬Å“no thanksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to act like a straight person. Their six-year-old son DJ says his two dads arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬Å“allowedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to get married, but that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to come to the reception and eat cake. Throw into the mix DanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straight siblings, whose varied choices form a microcosm of how Americans are approaching marriage these days, and you get a rollicking family memoir that will have everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€gay or straight, right or left, single or marriedÃ¢â‚¬â€howling with laughter and rethinking their notions of marriage and all it entails.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. The author of the internationally syndicated column &quot;Savage Love&quot; brings much-needed humor, and a reality check, to the bitter gay-marriage debate with this polemical memoir. As Savage (Skipping Towards Gomorrah) and his boyfriend, Terry, neared their 10th anniversary, Savage's mother put on the pressure for them to get married. But, Savage notes, there were several other points to consider before deciding to tie the knot: among them, the fact that marriage doesn't provide legal protection in Washington State; Terry prefers tattoos as a sign of commitment; and their six-year-old son declared that only men and women can get married. Furthermore, Savage himself worried that the relationship would be jinxed by anything more permanent than a big anniversary bash, though the one they plan quickly assumes the proportions and price of a wedding reception. While documenting the couple's wobble toward a decision, Savage skewers ideologues, both proÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and antiÃ¢â‚¬â€œgay marriage, with his radical pragmatism. Disproving Tolstoy's dictum that &quot;happy families are all alike,&quot; he takes a sharp-eyed, compassionate look at matrimony as it is actually practiced by friends, his raucously affectionate family and even medieval Christians. When he explains to his son what marriage is really about, you want to stand up and cheer, and the surprise ending is both hilarious and a tear-jerker. As funny as David Sedaris's essay collections, but bawdier and more thought-provoking, this timely book shows that being pro-family doesn't have to mean being anti-gay.
