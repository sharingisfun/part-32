Citizens are forced to take drugs that eliminate emotions. However, &quot;Sense Offenders&quot;: citizens who resist the laws and operate underground are continually at war with the Tetragrammaton. John Preston is a Cleric, an elite super-soldier who's mission is to hunt down and eliminate Sense Offenders with the help of a ruthless police force. One day, Preston accidentally breaks his morning dose of emotion suppressant drug and begins to feel. Soon, he begins sympathizing with the Sense Offenders and begins to understand the beauty of feeling... A beauty that the government, in which Preston spent his life serving, would like to see destroyed.\n\nStaring....\n\n    Christian Bale as John Preston\n    Taye Diggs as Andrew Brandt\n    Emily Watson as Mary O'Brien\n    Sean Bean as Errol Partridge\n    Angus Macfadyen as Vice-Counsel DuPont\n    William Fichtner as Jurgen\n    Sean Pertwee as Father\n    David Hemmings as Proctor\n    Emily Siewert as Lisa Preston\n    Matthew Harbour as Robbie Preston\n    Alexa Summer as Viviana Preston\n    Maria Pia Calzone as Preston's wife\n    Dominic Purcell as Seamus\n    Brian Conley as Reading room overseer\n    Kurt Wimmer as Rebel victim\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a1e05fe7017d89bb7011a2832ce0df9495e904","amp;dn":"Equilibrium+2002+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a1e05fe7017d89bb7011a2832ce0df9495e904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,161,224,95,231,1,125,137,187,112,17,162,131,44,224,223,148,149,233,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
