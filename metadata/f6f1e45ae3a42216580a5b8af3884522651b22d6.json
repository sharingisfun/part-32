SiÃƒÂ¢n and Ryan are reincarnations of Celtic lovers who were slaughtered long ago. They are unaware that obsessive love, power struggles and murder have followed them down through the ages. Thwarted in ancient times, a murderous spirit has followed them through time and now, with them all reunited in the 21st century, he plans to fulfil his malevolent vendetta.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nFrom a young age Ceri Norman's love of mythology and history has inspired her. After gaining a degree studying History and English, Ceri worked in libraries and museums where she shared this love with the people she met and worked with. Seeing the pleasure that books and history brought to people Ceri started writing fiction that people of all ages could enjoy and relate to. As a spiritual person she prefers her writing to have a spiritual and mystical flavour. Celtic Maidens is Ceri's first published novel and was inspired on a trip while investigating her Welsh roots, with her husband of many years. Deep in the Preseli Mountains they experienced the power of the mountains, the energy of the ancient monuments and some very bizarre weather. All of which have been atmospherically woven into this tale\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.  Please check your Bit-Torrent client for the true number of seeds.
