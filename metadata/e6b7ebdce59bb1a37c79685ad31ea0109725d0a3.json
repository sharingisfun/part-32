We also find smaller stories, the ones that warm your heart as well as the ones that break it. And we tell all these stories the way they should be told, showing you the whole picture.\n\nEvery picture tells a story. The better the picture, the better the story. And it doesn't get better than 16x9.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b7ebdce59bb1a37c79685ad31ea0109725d0a3","amp;dn":"16x9.2014.03.29.A.Fathers.Justice.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b7ebdce59bb1a37c79685ad31ea0109725d0a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,183,235,220,229,155,177,163,124,121,104,90,211,30,160,16,151,37,208,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
