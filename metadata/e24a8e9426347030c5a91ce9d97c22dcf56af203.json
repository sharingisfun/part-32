The Sixth Edition has been extensively revised and updated with the latest research in the field of cell biology, and it provides an exceptional framework for teaching and learning. The entire illustration program has been greatly enhanced.Protein structures better illustrate structureâ€“function relationships, icons are simpler and more consistent within and between chapters, and micrographs have been refreshed and updated with newer, clearer, or better images. As a new feature, each chapter now contains intriguing openended questions highlighting â€œWhat We Donâ€™t Know,â€ introducing students to challenging areas of future research. Updated end-of-chapter problems reflect new research discussed in the text, and these problems have been expanded to all chapters by adding questions on developmental biology, tissues and stem cells, pathogens, and the immune system.\r\n\r\nProduct Details\r\nPublisher: Garland Science; 6 edition (November 20, 2014)\r\nPublication Date: November 20, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nBruce Alberts, University of California, San Francisco, USA\r\n\r\nAlexander Johnson, University of California, San Francisco, USA\r\n\r\nJulian Lewis, (Deceased), formerly of Cancer Research UK\r\n\r\nDavid Morgan, University of California, San Francisco, USA\r\n\r\nMartin Raff, University College London, UK\r\n\r\nKeith Roberts, Emeritus, University of East Anglia, UK\r\n\r\nPeter Walter, University of California, San Francisco, USA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTAGS: Molecular Biology of the Cell,6e,6th edition,alberts,johnson,lewis,morgan,raff,roberts,walter,molecular,biology,2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24a8e9426347030c5a91ce9d97c22dcf56af203","amp;dn":"Molecular+Biology+of+the+Cell+6th+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24a8e9426347030c5a91ce9d97c22dcf56af203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,74,142,148,38,52,112,48,197,169,28,233,217,124,34,220,245,106,242,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
