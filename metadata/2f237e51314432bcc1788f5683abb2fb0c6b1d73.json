Think again. While version control tools are typically targeted at developers, anyone who works on a computer can benefit from them. Version control is the ultimate safety net, and an ongoing journal of your work. This course aims to empower designers, writers, photographers, teachers, and, yes, developers with the knowledge to integrate version control into their workflows. Author Joe Chellman dispels myths about version control and demos a simple version control project featuring not code, but a screenplay. He reviews examples of work that's well suited to version controlâ€”graphic design, web design, lesson planning, and even WordPress theme developmentâ€”and show what's possible when you begin sharing and collaborating with version control tools like GitHub and Bitbucket.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWeighing the pros and cons of version control\r\n\tâ€¢\tInstalling SourceTree\r\n\tâ€¢\tWriting in small and big chunks\r\n\tâ€¢\tCommitting changes\r\n\tâ€¢\tRevisiting previous revisions\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating and merging branches\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing version control with Word, Photoshop, Macaw, and WordPress\r\n\tâ€¢\tSharing version control projects\r\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f237e51314432bcc1788f5683abb2fb0c6b1d73","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Version+Control+for+Everyone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f237e51314432bcc1788f5683abb2fb0c6b1d73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,35,126,81,49,68,50,188,193,120,143,86,131,171,178,251,12,107,29,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
