But, the powers of Order and Chaos intervene, attempting to force Merlin to choose once and for all where his allegiance lies: the Courts of Chaos, Amber, the Lorgus, or the Unicorn. Deftly woven of suspense, intrigue, and imagery, Knight of Shadows is another colorful piece of the Amber puzzle, as well as a work of sophisticated fantasy by one of our leading word magicians.\n\n\n\nRead by Will Wheaton\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925cef2e55f0996e3b62c1493278841f856a1057","amp;dn":"Roger+Zelazny+-+Knight+of+Shadows+%28The+Chronicles+of+Amber+%239%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925cef2e55f0996e3b62c1493278841f856a1057","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,92,239,46,85,240,153,110,59,98,193,73,50,120,132,31,133,106,16,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
