A bootlegger calling itself Big Music obviously had a high-quality master recording to work with, for the sound quality is superb (by 1969 standards). In fact, one could go so far as to say that Another White Summer is a bootleg that would even impress an audiophile. The word superb also describes the performances themselves -- as much jamming and improvising as Robert Plant and Jimmy Page do, Zeppelin sounds quite focused on &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; and an 11-minute &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; as well as interpretations of Chicago blues classics like Howlin' Wolf's &quot;How Many More Times&quot; and Willie Dixon's &quot;You Shook Me.&quot; Meanwhile, two versions of the instrumental &quot;White Summer&quot; (one of which is a bonus track recorded in 1970 instead of 1969) find Page getting into some interesting, raga-influenced jamming. When this concert was recorded, Zeppelin only had one album out -- the ultra-influential Led Zeppelin II was still a few months away from being released. Easily recommended to heavy metal/hard rock and blues-rock lovers, Another White Summer is among the more rewarding bootlegs of Zeppelin's early concerts. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tBig Music\nCat.#\t\t\tBIG 070 \t\t\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nTracks 1-6: Playhouse Theatre, London June 27, 1969\nTrack 7: Julie Felix Show 1970\n\n\n\n\n01.Communication Breakdown (3:13)\n02.I Can't Quit You Baby (6:15)\n03.Dazed And Confused (11:13)\n04.White Summer/Black Mountain Side (8:10)\n05.You Shook Me (10:15)\n06.How Many More Times (12:32)\n07.White Summer (Bonus Track) (4:42)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718e5134cb0c811aee44ae422e7b22d75f41cfe6","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Another+White+Summer+%281993%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718e5134cb0c811aee44ae422e7b22d75f41cfe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,142,81,52,203,12,129,26,238,68,174,66,46,123,34,215,95,65,207,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
