Some writers start at the beginning and let the story unfold without a plan. They are called &quot;pantsers,&quot; because they write by the &quot;seat of the pants.&quot;\n\nOther writers plan and outline and know the ending before they start. These are the &quot;plotters.&quot;\n\nThe two sides never seem to agree with each other on the best approach.\n\nBut what if it's not the beginning or the end that is the key to a successful book? What if, amazing as it may seem, the place to begin writing your novel is in the very middle of the story?\n\nAccording to #1 bestselling writing teacher James Scott Bell, that's exactly where you'll find your story's heart and heat. Bell's &quot;Mirror Moment&quot; is the secret, and its power is available to any writer, at any stage of the writing process.\n\nBringing together years of craft study and personal discovery, Bell presents a truly unique approach to writing a novel, one that will stand the test of time and serve you all your writing life.\n\n&quot;I need three things before I tackle a new novel: Diet Coke, a laptop, and my dog-eared copies of James Scott Bell's books on writing craft!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Kami Garcia, #1 NYT Times &amp; International Bestselling author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4d709e9eb1501e922ea7a743d8024993889f7df","amp;dn":"James+Scott+Bell+-+Write+Your+Novel+From+The+Middle%3A+A+New+Appro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4d709e9eb1501e922ea7a743d8024993889f7df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,215,9,233,235,21,1,233,34,234,122,116,61,128,36,153,56,137,247,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
