Music is mostly Gothic, Darkwave and Dark Electro oriented and includes electronics, dancing beats , as well as symphonic elements, melodies and distorted vocals. A few tracks ('Devil Worship' and 'Hexentanz') have been already composed before the foundation of the project, and the other have become the result of the work during 2010-2012.\nDespite the fact that Distorted World is mostly studio project, the first live-show was performed in January 2012 in a Moscow club. Later Distorted World took part in a few shows with the well-known headliners such as Grendel, Detroit Diesel, Uberbyte, Centhrone; some tracks were included in gothic and industrial compilations.\nA dark and mysterious atmosphere is one of the most important parts in music of Distorted World, which is complemented by English lyrics (excl. 'Hexentanz', which is in German) describing extramundane worlds, ominous rituals and dark corners of a humans mind.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Intro\n02.Mysterious World\n03.Between the Strophes\n04.Dream (feat.
