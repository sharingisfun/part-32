Stack the blocks to the target height, but make sure they do not fall. Great challenge and high scores are saved fo players to show off how good they are.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://market.android.com/details?id=com.ElusiveByte.UTetris&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5FbHVzaXZlQnl0ZS5VVGV0cmlzIl0.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://market.android.com/details?id=com.ElusiveByte.UTetris&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5FbHVzaXZlQnl0ZS5VVGV0cmlzIl0.&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRobert on January 17, 2012 (Samsung Galaxy S with version 1.2)\nGreat game, fun and realistic.\nOnly reason I am rating it four stars is that it is a bit slow at first, and that there is a block that has five squares. This doesn't follow tetris in that tetris means four. But it is still a good game and the block makes sense in some ways. Thanks for the work devs!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0de8cb7ba2aacd5e401670f04c5cd8cef9a5e43","amp;dn":"Unstable+Tetris+For+Android+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0de8cb7ba2aacd5e401670f04c5cd8cef9a5e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,222,140,183,186,42,172,213,228,1,103,15,4,197,205,140,239,154,94,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
