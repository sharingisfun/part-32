I sure hope all of these work on other peoples' computers. . . They all work fine for me so. . .\n\nWell yes! This is Fighting For One Piece, a One Piece game that I am sure did not get to America, I think. . . Oh well, even so, who ever desires the Japanese version one, it is here. lXD It is a simple fighting game with a few One Piece characters. Worth a try. \n\nEnjoy, and thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:533322c81415e4a491093d38ce71020c8dc7964b","amp;dn":"Fighting+For+One+Piece","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"533322c81415e4a491093d38ce71020c8dc7964b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,51,34,200,20,21,228,164,145,9,61,56,206,113,2,12,141,199,150,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
