The author, architect Koji Yagi, explains the basic elements of Japanese interior design and shows you how to use them.\n\nInstall tatami mats and shoji doors-cardinal elements of Japanese interior design-and see how beautifully they respond to the Western home. Change the size and shape of a room easily and tastefully with bamboo screens and movable partitions. Build a simple Japanese-style alcove, decorate it with something special, and then flaunt it. Try some Japanese lighting techniques-low, soft, and beautiful. Change the mood of a room, and change your way of looking at things.\n\nA Japanese Touch for Your Home includes much more. Practical, approachable, and authentic, it is written by a prominent Japanese architect concerned about the demands of contemporary lifestyles, and the answers that traditional Japanese design has to offer.\n\nOver 120 color plates taken by a leading Japanese photographer accompany the informed text. In addition, over 200 black and white sketches, floor plans, and a section on do-it-yourself projects make this a book that will pique your desire to be creative and then show you how to fulfill it. A practical guide for homeowners, interior designers, and people who like to work with their heads and their hands, this book will introduce you to a new way of living.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 84 pages\n    * Publisher: Kodansha USA (April 15, 1992)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 477001662X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-4770016621","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a69e427ead18ec455287b54d1cb8b79ff997f8","amp;dn":"Japanese+Touch+for+Your+Home+%28BBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28a69e427ead18ec455287b54d1cb8b79ff997f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,166,158,66,126,173,24,236,69,82,135,181,77,28,184,183,159,249,151,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
