Members Greg Churchouse, Peter Ellard, and Roy Stride signed with Epic Records in early 2007 and released their first single, &quot;It's Not About You,&quot; that June. Soon after, the band's self-titled debut reached the top slot on the U.K. album charts, thanks to the popularity of such singles as &quot;She's So Lovely,&quot; &quot;Elvis Ain't Dead,&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat.&quot; The band returned to the studio in 2009, and the following year released its second album, Everybody Wants to Be on TV, on Epic. In 2012 Scouting for Girls released the single &quot;Summertime in the City,&quot; which heralded the release of their third studio album, The Light Between Us. \n\nArtist...............: Scouting For Girls\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits (Deluxe Edition)\nGenre................: Alternative-Rock\nSource...............: CD {Sony #88883737082}\nYear.................: 2013\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 73 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 3/15/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, CUE, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
