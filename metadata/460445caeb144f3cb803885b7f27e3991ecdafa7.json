As such, the DDnzrf has normal passenger accommodation together with a drivers cab but no pantograph or motors. In this add-on the control cars are coupled with a Class 143 pusher locomotive. The Silberlinge coaches were initially restricted to 120 km/h but were upgraded after 1970 to 140 km/h, and have been re-liveried and reconfigured inside over the years since their introduction.\n\n\nIncludes\nControl Car BDnzrf in Traffic Red and Mint Green liveries\nSilberlinge ABn and Bn coaches in Traffic Red and Mint Green liveries\n\n5 scenarios:\nRSB 3171\nTypical Local Traffic\nCurious InterRegio\nTo Suffer in Winter\nNice Summer Day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460445caeb144f3cb803885b7f27e3991ecdafa7","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+German+Control+Cars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460445caeb144f3cb803885b7f27e3991ecdafa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,4,69,202,235,20,79,60,184,3,136,91,127,39,227,153,30,205,175,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
