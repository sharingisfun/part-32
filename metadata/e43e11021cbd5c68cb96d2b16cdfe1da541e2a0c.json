The seventh child of the Jackson family, Michael Jackson debuted on the professional music scene at the age of eleven as a member of the Jackson 5, and went on to become a pop icon as a solo artist. His successful career and controversial, enigmatic personal life have been a part of pop culture for almost four decades. Jackson has dominated pop music since the late 1970s, becoming the first black entertainer to amass a strong cross-over following on MTV with his revolutionary transformation of the music video as an art form and as a promotional tool.\n\nDangerous was the first album Michael Jackson released in the 1990s, on November 22, 1991. It became Jacksons second album to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, where it spent the next 4 weeks selling 7 million copies in the U.S. his third best-selling album there. With sales of approximately 30 million copies worldwide, it is Jacksons best-selling recording of the nineties and near ties with Bad as his second-best selling album, behind Thriller.\n\nTrack list:\n01 Jam\n02 Why You Wanna Trip On Me\n03 In The Closet\n04 She Drives Me Wild\n05 Remember The Time\n06 Cant Let Her Get Away\n07 Heal The World\n08 Black Or White\n09 Who Is It\n10 Give In To Me\n11 Will You Be There\n12 Keep The Faith\n13 Gone Too Soon\n14 Dangerous","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43e11021cbd5c68cb96d2b16cdfe1da541e2a0c","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+Dangerous-B0GG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43e11021cbd5c68cb96d2b16cdfe1da541e2a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,62,17,2,28,189,92,104,203,150,210,177,108,223,225,218,84,30,42,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
