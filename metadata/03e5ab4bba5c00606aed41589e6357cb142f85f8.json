His impulsive marriage to independent artist Loretta is a happiness he never thought heâ€™d find. And when heâ€™s tapped by J. Edgar Hoover to be the FBIâ€™s first African-American agent, he sees a once-in-a-lifetime chance to secure real justice.\r\nInstead of providing evidence against Marcus Garvey, prominent head of the â€œdangerously radicalâ€ back-to-Africa movement, Sidney uses his unexpected knack for deception and undercover work to thwart the Bureauâ€™s biased investigation. And by giving renowned leader W. E. B. Du Bois insider information, Sidney gambles on change that could mean a fair destiny for all Americansâ€¦\r\nBut the higher Sidney and Loretta climb in Harlemâ€™s most influential and glamorous circles, the more dangerous the stakes. An unexpected friendship and a wrenching personal tragedy threaten to shatter Lorettaâ€™s innocent trust in her husbandâ€”and turn his double life into a fast-closing trap. For Sidney, ultimately squeezed between the Bureau and one too many ruthless factions, the price of escape could be heartbreak and betrayal no amount of skill can help him survive.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e5ab4bba5c00606aed41589e6357cb142f85f8","amp;dn":"The+Strivers+Row+Spy+-+Jason+Overstreet+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e5ab4bba5c00606aed41589e6357cb142f85f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,229,171,75,186,92,0,96,106,237,65,88,158,99,87,203,20,47,133,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
