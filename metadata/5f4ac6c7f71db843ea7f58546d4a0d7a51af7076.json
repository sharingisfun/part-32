The satisfying conclusion of the seven years of tribulation covered by the Left Behind series portrays the return of Jesus Christ to earth in both glory and judgment at the height of the battle between the forces of evil gathered at Armageddon and the remaining Christian believers at Petra and Jerusalem. Nothing seems to be able to stop the Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia. But God is in control.\n\nGenre: Futuristic\nLanguage: English\nPublisher: Gap DIGITAL &amp; Tyndale House Publishing\nDramatized radio adaptation\nFormat: MP3,\nBit rate: 128kbps mp3 format\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4ac6c7f71db843ea7f58546d4a0d7a51af7076","amp;dn":"12+-+Glorious+Appearing+by+Tim+LaHaye%2C+Jerry+B.+Jenkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4ac6c7f71db843ea7f58546d4a0d7a51af7076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,74,198,199,247,29,184,67,234,127,88,84,109,74,13,122,81,175,112,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
