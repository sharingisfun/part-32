As usual, Batman tries to rid Gotham\nCity of evil, but he's not doing it alone. Assisting the Caped Crusader are retired\nMI-6 operative Alfred Pennyworth, who also serves as the superhero's butler, and\nlethal swordswoman Tatsu &quot;Katana&quot; Yamashiro. Among the villains who lead Gotham\nCity's criminal underworld that Batman and his crew battle are Anarky, Professor\nPyg, Mister Toad and Magpie.\n\nProduced by DC Entertainment, Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network.\n\n\nWhen Bruce Wayne is &quot;assassinated&quot; by Batman, he lets the world\nthink he's dead and goes in search of the imposter - the Bad Batman.\n\nBeware.the.Batman.S01E24.Epitaph.WEBCap.x264.AAC.mp4\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x404 25.000fps [CRF 20.0]\nAudio: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 44100Hz stereo  [128Kbps ABR]\nDuration: 00:20:54\nFile size: 103 MB\n\n\n* Episode 25 &quot;Twist&quot; is unavailable.
