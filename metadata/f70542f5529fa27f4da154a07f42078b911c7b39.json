Originally written by Robert Ponger and Falco, the Falco version reached the top of the charts in many countries.\n\nAfter The Fire's version featured English lyrics by the band's Andy Piercy. The song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.\n\nJohann (Hans) HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶lzel (19 February 1957 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian rap, pop and rock musician and had four #1 Hits - &quot;Der Kommissar,&quot; &quot;Rock Me Amadeus,&quot; &quot;Jeanny,&quot; and &quot;Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2).&quot; He is the first and so far only artist to score a #1 Hit in the U.S. with a German language song.\n\nHis albums and singles have sold about 60 million copies worldwide.\n\nFalco's first hit was &quot;Der Kommissar,&quot; from the 1982 album Einzelhaft. A German language song about drug consumption that combines rap verses with a sung chorus, Falco's record was a number-one success in many countries but failed to break big in the U.S. The song, however, would prove to have a life of its own in two English-language versions. British Rock band After the Fire recorded an English cover version, loosely based on Falco's lyrics and also called &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; (with &quot;uh-oh&quot; and &quot;alles klar Herr Kommissar&quot; the only other lyrics held over from the original). This time, the song shot to number three in the United States (their only major hit there) in 1983, though it failed to crack the UK Top 40. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who had been together more than a decadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½broke up almost immediately thereafter. That same year, American singer Laura Branigan recorded a version of the song with new English lyrics, under the title &quot;Deep In The Dark,&quot; on her album Branigan 2.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f70542f5529fa27f4da154a07f42078b911c7b39","amp;dn":"Falco+-+Der+Kommissar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f70542f5529fa27f4da154a07f42078b911c7b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,5,66,245,82,159,162,127,77,161,84,160,127,66,7,139,145,28,123,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
