Jackie Brentson and his Delta Cats had a number one on the R&amp;B charts with it, and a teenage Ike Turner played piano alongside his Rhythm Kings. Some say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the first time a distorted guitar was recorded. One story is that the bands amp fell off the roof of a car while drivingÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and to fix the amp, somebody stuffed it with newspaper to keep the wrecked cone in placeÃ¢â‚¬â€œ which then created a fuzzy tone. Besides that story, this song was often debated among musicologists as being the first rock and roll record. Musically thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much going on in the original versionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Jackie is singing in C, and the rest of the band is playing in E flat. The original has a great feel, and sometimes, wreckless in natureÃ¢â‚¬â€œand I always thought that this would make a fantastic instrumental.\n \nTim Timebomb- Guitar\nDave Brophy-Drums\nJoe McMahon- Bass\nRusty Scott-Piano\nMike Mele- Guitar\nJohn Aruda-Sax\nScott Aruda-Trumpet\nJeff Gallindo- Trombone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92cd0b64c3df6e9aa9cc5c3f33ca976bc9b68796","amp;dn":"Rocket+88+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92cd0b64c3df6e9aa9cc5c3f33ca976bc9b68796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,205,11,100,195,223,110,154,169,204,92,63,51,202,151,107,201,182,135,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
