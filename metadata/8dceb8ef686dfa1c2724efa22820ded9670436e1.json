It specialises in the international football scene. Its regular contributing writers include Brian Glanville, Sid Lowe and Tim Vickery. World Soccer is a member of the European Sports Magazines (ESM), an umbrella group of similar magazines printed in other languages. Other members include A Bola, Don BalÃƒÂ³n, Kicker, La Gazzetta dello Sport and Sport Express. The members of this group elect a European &quot;Team of the Month&quot;, and a European &quot;Team of the Year&quot;.\nSince 1982 World Soccer has also organised &quot;Player of the Year&quot;, &quot;Manager of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Team of the Year&quot; awards. In 2005 awards for the best &quot;Young Player of the Year&quot; and &quot;Referee of the Year&quot; were also introduced. In the December 1999 issue of World Soccer, a readers' poll listing the 100 greatest football players of the 20th century was published.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dceb8ef686dfa1c2724efa22820ded9670436e1","amp;dn":"World+Soccer+++May+2012+%28.PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dceb8ef686dfa1c2724efa22820ded9670436e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,206,184,239,104,109,250,28,39,36,239,162,40,32,222,217,103,4,54,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
