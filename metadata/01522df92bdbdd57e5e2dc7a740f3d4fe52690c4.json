Surprisingly progressive, a bit like early FOCUS, although maybe less hard rock (the electric guitar is slightly more shy). The keyboards are mostly floating and rythmic organ full of effects, and some mellotron, piano and VCS3 parts. The bass is quite present and rather complex. There are tons of sophisticated drums. The lead vocals are very good, as always. You listen the early CAMEL mainly because of the outstanding keyboards.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the music fluctuates uncertainly between arty improvisations, jazz-inflected rhythms, and uninspired rock numbers. There are hints of promise scattered throughout the album, yet the record never gels into something special.\r\n\r\nBig debut for Camel! It contains more jazzy sound than most of the albums in progressive rock music. But it has a little harder sound, too. The strongest songs are in the middle of the album which is unusually for most of the albums. Songs like Six Ate, Separation and Never Let Go make the album essential. \r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
