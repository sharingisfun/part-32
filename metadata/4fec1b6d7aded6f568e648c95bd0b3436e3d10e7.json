Sounding a bit like Ray Charles crossed with a veteran Chicago bluesman, NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meth knows his way around a blues tune (he covers Willie Dixon's &quot;Sit Cry the Blues&quot; here, for instance), but he shines brightest when he moves from his beloved blues into more soulful R&amp;B territory, which allows his truly expressive voice to work its wonders. The best tracks on Magic Touch, including the striking &quot;Blue Broadway,&quot; the sly &quot;You're an Angel&quot; and the she-done-me-wrong ballad &quot;Up to No Good,&quot; all of which are NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meth originals, exhibit a kind of bluesy R&amp;B feel, bolstered by the presence of the Texas Horns and NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meth's own hornlike harmonica lines. Each of these songs feels like it has been around for years, and NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meth's singing finds all the right corners in them, blending a soulful approach with a refreshing dose of sly humor. One gets the impression that Magic Touch is just a starting point, though, and that NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meth's best work is yet to come. He's got a voice that can sing anything, and his harmonica playing is bright, jazzy and inspired, but it's his writing that is the silver bullet here. If it continues to develop to keep pace with his performing skills, NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©meth may well have a truly monster album coming just down the road.\n\nTracklist:\n1. Blues Hit Big Town 3:39\n2.
