The desire to own the skulls of the famous, for study, for sale, for public (and private) display, seems to be instinctual and irresistible in some people. The rise of phrenology at the beginning of the 19th century only fed that fascination with the belief that genius leaves its mark on the very shape of the head. Fully illustrated with some surprising images, this is a fascinating and authoritative history of ideas carried along on the guilty pleasures of real-after-life gothic tales.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e05f6bb7459fcebb72aa2e4673b8c203a41496c","amp;dn":"Cranioklepty+-+Grave+Robbing+and+the+Search+for+Genius+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e05f6bb7459fcebb72aa2e4673b8c203a41496c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,5,246,187,116,89,252,235,183,42,162,228,103,59,140,32,58,65,73,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
