Ginell\n\nAnother year, another Red Hot project of unlikely musical bedfellows, this time \npaying tribute in their divergent ways to George Gershwin in the year of his \ncentennial. All kinds of styles are tossed about, from a full symphony orchestra \nto the latest hip-hop and retro-electronic techniques. The tracks that work the \nbest are those that seem to use Gershwin simply as a point of departure for \ntheir own agendas: to cite a few, Smoke City's odd combination of electronica \nand Brazilian rhythm on &quot;They Can't Take That Away from Me,&quot; Michael Franti's \ninterpolated ghetto raps in the middle of Spearhead/Ernest Ranglin's cool, hip-\nhop &quot;I Got Plenty O' Nuthin.&quot; As a pocket sampling of the differing approaches, \nMorcheeba's ultra-sultry vocal teams up with Hubert Laws' flute on a most \neffective &quot;Summertime,&quot; while an aging Bobby Womack successfully fuses rap and \n'70s funk on the same tune. On the other hand, while it's nice to hear \nperformers from the ranks of Generation X and thereabouts taking enough interest \nin Gershwin to try and interpret his tunes straight on, many of them simply do \nnot have the expressiveness in their voices to get much out of the songs. Either \nthat or their deliberately ironic stances preclude emotion; nothing seems to \ntouch them, they sound disembodied and vacant. Rock veteran David Bowie turns \nout to be the most affecting balladeer of them all in &quot;A Foggy Day,&quot; accompanied \nby film composer Angelo Badalamenti's brooding strings. The only standalone jazz \npersonality is Clark Terry, who growls a brief &quot;Let's Call the Whole Thing Off&quot; \nin his &quot;mumbles&quot; voice while blowing a bit of muted trumpet overhead. Though \nbackloading the CD with sustained ballads drains much of its energy, the album \nis never less than absorbing. Yet there is little fusion of eras and attitudes, \nnor a sense of passing the torch as there is on the thrilling Red Hot + Rio \npackage. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and expecting a\nrelease, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and expressing this is\nlegitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+\npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading\nand therefore, sharing. But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself,\nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused\ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING\nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT. This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent\nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:519f311cc9047f32fec84f6c24a6c59c9ecb9eb6","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+%2B+Rhapsody++The+Gershwin+Groove+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"519f311cc9047f32fec84f6c24a6c59c9ecb9eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,159,49,28,201,4,127,50,254,200,79,108,36,166,197,156,158,203,158,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
