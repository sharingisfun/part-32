Their first album &quot;Madra&quot; (1991) was entirely 'a cappella', with the songs all based on traditional English verse.\n\nBy the following year and this second release, the &quot;Iris&quot; EP (1992), their sound had evolved, and their madrigal-styled vocals had blended with aspects of gothic rock, darkwave, and industrial music.\n\nThis EP is thus their first release in the style for which they are known - as typified by their second album (&quot;Suspiria&quot; which appeared the following year, 1993).\n\nIt is very surprising that this &quot;Iris&quot; EP is not already here at TPB in a convential format, but it contains some of their best work, and was the first sign of things to come, so here it is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed14490cd19d006a1d02dccee008e8a9e717180d","amp;dn":"Miranda+Sex+Garden+-+Iris+%281992+EP%29+%28indie+rock%29+%28mp3%29%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed14490cd19d006a1d02dccee008e8a9e717180d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,20,73,12,209,157,0,106,29,2,220,206,224,8,232,169,231,23,24,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
