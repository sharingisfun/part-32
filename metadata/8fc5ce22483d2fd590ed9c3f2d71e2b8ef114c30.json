The authors document the trend in each of these components over the last 30 years, using figures (trend lines and bar charts) based upon the best available data. Collectively, this evidence has alarming implications for the economic fate of those at the bottom of the nation's income distribution. For that group, as the authors show, the American Dream is dying. \n\nDecember 2009\nPublisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.\nFormat: Hardcover 144pp \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc5ce22483d2fd590ed9c3f2d71e2b8ef114c30","amp;dn":"American+Dream+Dying","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc5ce22483d2fd590ed9c3f2d71e2b8ef114c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,197,206,34,72,61,47,213,144,237,156,63,45,113,226,184,239,17,76,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
