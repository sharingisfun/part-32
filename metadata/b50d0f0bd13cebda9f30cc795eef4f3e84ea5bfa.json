The son of wealthy restauranteur Rocky Aoki, he is\nof Japanese heritage and calls Los Angeles home. In 2007 he released his first\nofficial mix CD, Pillowface and His Airplane Chronicles, on Thrive Records.\nFeaturing tracks by Justice, Klaxons, Mystery Jets, Peaches, Datarock, Yelle,\nFranz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, and Scanners -- most of them remixed -- Pillowface\nand His Airplane Chronicles is fairly representative of Aoki's renown as a\ntastemaking dance-party DJ rather than a skillful turntablist.\n\n\n\nIn 2009 his remix work brought rapper DrakeÃƒâ€ s single ÃƒÂ´ForeverÃƒÂ¶ to the\ndancefloor, while 2010 saw him release the &quot;I'm in the House&quot; single with Zuper\nBlahq, alter ego of Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am. Further high-profile\nartistsÃƒâ€  material was also re-worked by Aoki during this period, with tracks by\nMichael Jackson, the Killers and Lenny Kravitz all benefiting; while\ncollaborations with like-minded producers such as Armand van Helden and the\nBloody Beetroots continued to appear on Dim Mak. By the end of 2011, the early\nfruits of sessions for his debut artist album Wonderland had materialized as the\nsingles ÃƒÂ´Earthquakey PeopleÃƒÂ¶ - a collaboration with Weezer singer Rivers Cuomo -\nand ÃƒÂ´TornadoÃƒÂ¶, on which Aoki combined forces with the multi-award winning\nTiesto.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50d0f0bd13cebda9f30cc795eef4f3e84ea5bfa","amp;dn":"Steve+Aoki-Wonderland-Bonus+Track-2012-JUST+%2ANEW%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50d0f0bd13cebda9f30cc795eef4f3e84ea5bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,13,15,11,209,60,235,218,159,48,204,121,94,239,79,62,132,234,91,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
