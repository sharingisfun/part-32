In the wake of remixes for acts including the Outhere Brothers, Technotronic, and Haddaway, he scored a European club hit with 1999's &quot;9 PM (Till I Come),&quot; releasing the full-length Movin' Melodies later that same year. At the end of October 2000, Tanneberger released his sophomore album, Two Worlds. For the album ATB collaborated with Heather Nova, Enigma, and the Canadian rock band Wild Strawberries. The release was a double CD, the first consisting of more dancefloor-friendly tunes and the second, more downtempo. In mid-2000 Tannenberg released the single &quot;Killer,&quot; a remake of the Seal and Adamski track, with Drew Williams on vocals. Two Worlds was issued later that fall, followed by several compilations and singles. It wasn't until 2002 that a new full-length album would appear; Dedicated arrived that spring. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01. 9 PM (Till I Come)\n02.
