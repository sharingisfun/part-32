The author concentrates on that class of problems concerned with computing a system of bilinear forms. Results that lead to applications in the area of signal processing are emphasized, since (1) even a modest reduction in the execution time of signal processing problems could have practical significance; (2) results in this area are relatively new and are scattered in journal articles; and (3) this emphasis indicates the flavor of complexity of computation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0812860433007c6c6d8c9a96427306625cda848f","amp;dn":"arithmetic_complexity_of_computations.djvu-WaRlOrD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0812860433007c6c6d8c9a96427306625cda848f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,18,134,4,51,0,124,108,109,140,154,150,66,115,6,98,92,218,132,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
