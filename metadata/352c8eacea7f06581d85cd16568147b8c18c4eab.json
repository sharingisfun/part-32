THE FIRST HOUR IS MISSING.\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThere are two Beatle's remakes in this countdown.\n\nCasey says there have only been four songs in the rock era that have made the top 40 with only numerals for a title (he doesn't know about 1999 yet). One is at number 28, Casey lists the other three.\n\nOne artist in the countdown was once described by Newsweek magazine as the greatest live entertainer in rock history.\n\nAnother artist in the countdown had 6, million selling albums in the three years prior.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which American act has had the most number ones in the 70's?&quot;\n\nIn the rock era, only two women have been able to put two songs in the top ten at the same time, and they're both in this countdown.\n\nI left the station ID in this recording so, as of this posting, here are some of the best stations to hear future AT40 broadcasts.\n\nAll Times Central in the US:\n\nAmerican Top 40 the 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s:\n\n94.5 KOOL FM in Phoenix, AZ: starts at 8 am Saturday (plays extras)\n\n970 WGTK in Louisville, KY: starts at 5 pm Saturday\n\nMagic 98 in Madison, WI: starts at 9 pm Saturday (best uninterrupted stream)\n\nAmerican Top 40 the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s:\n\nMagic 98 in Madison, WI: starts at Noon Sunday (best uninterrupted stream)\n\n102.7 Jack FM in Baltimore, MD: starts at 7pm Sunday (plays extras)\n\nFickle 93.3 in Fairport, NY: starts at 5am Sunday (plays extras but lets the commercials bleed into the show badly)\n\n\n30: It's A Laugh - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n29: Josie - Steely Dan\n28: 5705 - City Boy\n27: Beast Of Burden - Rolling Stones\n26: Double Vision - Foreigner\nLDD: One Tin Soldier - Coven\n25: Talking In Your Sleep - Crystal Gayle\n24: I Love The Nightlife - Alisha Bridges\n23: Come Together - Aerosmith\n22: Who Are You - The Who\n21: MacArthur Park - Donna Summer\nExtra: I Want You Back - Jackson Five\n20: You Never Done It Like That - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n19: She's Always A Woman - Billy Joel\n18: Back In The USA - Linda Ronstadt\n17: Get Off - Foxy\n16: How Much I Feel - Ambrosia\nExtra: You Light Up My Life - Debbie Boone\n15: Oh Darlin' - Robin Gibb\n14: Baker Street - Jerry Rafferty\n13: Everlasting Love - Andy Gibb\n12: Hollywood Nights - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullitt Band\n11: Three Times A Lady - Commodores\nExtra: Venus - Shocking Blue\n10: Whenever I Call You Friend - Kenny Loggins &amp; Stevie Nicks\n9: You Needed Me - Anne Murray\n8: Love Is In The Air - John Paul Young\n7: Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton-John\n6: Reminising - Little River Band\nLDD: Sunshine - John Denver\n5: Summer Nights - John Travolta &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n4: Don't Look Back - Boston\n3: Hot Child In The City - Nick Guilder\nRock Fossil: Until I Kissed 'Ya - Everly Brothers\n2: Boogie Oogie Oogie - A Taste Of Honey\n1: Kiss You All Over - Exile\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352c8eacea7f06581d85cd16568147b8c18c4eab","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_October_7th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352c8eacea7f06581d85cd16568147b8c18c4eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,44,142,172,234,127,6,88,29,133,205,22,86,129,71,184,193,140,78,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
