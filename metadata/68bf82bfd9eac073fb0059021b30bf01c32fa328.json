Support them if you like the music! Will upload wav/ogg on request.\n\n&quot;Bursting into 2013 with a co-production credit on A$AP RockyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forthcoming Long, Live, A$AP, French turntablist foursome Birdy Nam Nam keep it moving by announcing the Defiant Order EP, a mid-tempo masterpiece paired with re-workings by hip-hop and left-field influencers such as Ed Banger secret weapon Breakbot, syrupy Huntsville go-to heatmakers Block Beattaz, three-time consecutive DMC World Champion DJ Craze, and buzzing masked assailant UZ. The EP will be the group's second project on Skrillex's OWSLA.\n\nBNN made their early mark by dominating the 2002 DMC World DJ Championship, and more recently by taking home a Victoire de la Musique (French equivalent of a Grammy) in 2010. The team, a super-unique spoke in the wheel of electronic music (they manhandle four Numarks live, editing in real-time with lightning-quick fader cuts), closed 2012 with their latest effort, the phenomenal Jaded Future EP which featured compatriots Para One and Teki Latex.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68bf82bfd9eac073fb0059021b30bf01c32fa328","amp;dn":"Birdy+Nam+Nam+-+Defiant+Order+EP+%28320+KBPS%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68bf82bfd9eac073fb0059021b30bf01c32fa328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,191,130,191,217,234,192,115,251,0,89,2,27,48,191,1,195,47,163,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
