A business analyst who seemingly went to college all those years so you can spend your days copying data from reports into spreadsheets? A programmer who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t finish each dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s task without having to scan through version control system output, looking for the file you want?\n\nIf so, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re wasting that computer on your desk. Offload the drudgery to where it belongs, and free yourself to do what you should be doing: thinking. All you need is a scripting language (free!), this book (cheap!), and the dedication to work through the examples and exercises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6dba08aad00094c99064cd39659102bee062e9","amp;dn":"Everyday+Scripting+with+Ruby+%5BPragmatic+Programmers+2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6dba08aad00094c99064cd39659102bee062e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,109,186,8,170,208,0,148,201,144,100,205,57,101,145,2,190,224,98,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
