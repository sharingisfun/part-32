A historical look at counting cards in blackjack. With Edward O. Thorp, Andy Bloch, Semyon Dukach, Anthony Curtis, and others. Covering the birth of the counting system, MIT teams, Using computers, casino security and surveillance, etc.\n\nMaking Millions the Easy Way\nCard counting and beating the casinos at their own game.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a team of American science students took on the might of the Las Vegas casinos, and came home with millions of dollars. Hardworking engineering students during the week, they became high-rolling gamblers by the weekend and proved that, in one game at least, the house doesn&amp;#039;t always win.\n\nThe game was blackjack, and the students were from the world-renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Their audacious winnings marked the climax of an arms race between casino and player that began 40 years earlier with maths professor Edward Thorp. He realised that the one feature of blackjack that made it different from other casino games also made it possible to beat.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/million_prog_summary.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/million_prog_summary.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDocumentary\nEnglish\nNo subtitles\nDuration : 00:48:46\n[Video]\nResolution : 352x288\nCodec : MPEG 1\nFPS : 25.00\nBitRate : 1090 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0.44 b/px\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 Layer 2\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nNOTE: I did not rip this one.
