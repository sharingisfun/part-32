These packages may include other ab initio and\nsemi-empirical packages such as GAMESS and MOPAC2007. Included with\nHyperChem 8 is the copyrighted source code for a number of these\ninterfaces. A standard menu item in HyperChem, &quot;Third-Party Interfaces\nexecutes a standard HyperChem Command Language (HCL) script installed\nwith the product. This script has the pre-defined name, thirdparty.scr\nThis script can be modified by users to add other third-party\napplications but comes included with a variety of evolving interfaces\nThese interfaces uses the elegant &quot;open architecture&quot; features of\nHyperChem that allow software outside HyperChem to interact and\nread/write information to/from HyperChem. The interface software is\ncopyrighted &quot;Open Source&quot; software that any HyperChem user can modify to\nimprove the interface or to create a new interface to his/her own\nsoftware. The interfaces generally allow a user, for example, to run a\nGAMESS job from within HyperChem, and get back the results for display\nThe first level of interface, that is included to begin with in\nHyperChem 8, allows a user to display optimized structures, vibrational\nspectra and animations of normal modes plus 3D renderings of orbitals,\nelectron densities, and electrostatic potentials. It is to be expected\nthat these interfaces evolve to become richer as users and members of\nHypercube, Inc. contribute to their capability\n\nHyperChem has traditionally operated in a purely interactive mode where\na calculation (a back end, e.g. HyperNewton) is connected in a &quot;live\nfashion&quot; to HyperChem (the front end). This has been the case even when\nthe back end resided on another machine on the network. This is not a\nterrible limitation since once can run many HyperChem front ends\nsimultaneously if one likes. With HyperChem 8, however, one now has the\nchoice of running a calculation interactively or in Batch mode. In Batch\nmode the computation is severed and carries on by itself while HyperChem\nis free to read in a new molecule or continue on in any way it pleases,\nincluding spawning more batched jobs. The back ends have been instructed\nby the front end that they are indeed batch processes and instead of\nsending their results live to the front end, they create a .ext file\nthat can be read at any later time into the HyperChem front end to\ndisplay the results just as if the calculation was run interactively\n\nand more\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hyper.com/Products/HyperChemProfessional/75Overview/tabid/361/Default.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hyper.com/Products/HyperChemProfessional/75Overview/tabid/361/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nUnzip, Unrar.
