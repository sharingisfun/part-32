HolmesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ enemy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Professor James Moriarty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a lost man. MI5 blackmails Moriarty into finding Holmes' long-lost brother, Mycroft, but what at first appears to be a routine case leads to a web of intrigue that involves a psychic box and its creator, a woman from MoriartyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s past, and a new villain that threatens to be greater than Moriarty ever was!\n\nIn the wake of The Dark Chamber, Professor Moriarty finds himself afflicted with unsettling visions. He sets sail for Burma in search of an old ally, but finds himself caught up in a city on the brink of revolt, a troublesome Imperial Policeman, and a secret that holds the key to his destiny.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=31918&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=31918&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sherlocknews.com/2011/03/comic-moriarty-coming-in-may-2011-from.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sherlocknews.com/2011/03/comic-moriarty-coming-in-may-2011-from.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.geeksofdoom.com/2011/10/04/comic-review-moriarty-5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.geeksofdoom.com/2011/10/04/comic-review-moriarty-5/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nMoriarty 01 - The Dark Chamber - Part 1.cbz\t28.7 MB\t\nMoriarty 02 - The Dark Chamber - Part 2.cbz\t32.0 MB\t\nMoriarty 03 - The Dark Chamber - Part 3.cbz\t22.8 MB\t\nMoriarty 04 - The Dark Chamber - Part 4.cbz\t26.1 MB\t\n\nMoriarty 05 - The Lazarus Tree - Part 1.cbz\t26.2 MB\t\nMoriarty 06 - The Lazarus Tree - Part 2.cbz\t27.5 MB\t\nMoriarty 07 - The Lazarus Tree - Part 3.cbz\t27.3 MB\t\nMoriarty 08 - The Lazarus Tree - Part 4.cbz\t34.9 MB\t\nMoriarty 09 - The Lazarus Tree - Part 5.cbz\t35.2 MB\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5141a85d4aafd75e397abf7053578ea4388d346","amp;dn":"Moriarty+%281-9%2C+Collected%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5141a85d4aafd75e397abf7053578ea4388d346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,20,26,133,212,170,253,117,227,151,171,247,5,53,120,234,67,136,211,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
