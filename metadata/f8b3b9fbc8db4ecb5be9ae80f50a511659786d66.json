Several cryptic scenes refer to the oppressive Thai political situation. A clear reaction to the new law that subjected his previous film, This Area Is Under Quarantine (2009), to censorship.\n\nReincarnate starts with a text: 'Thailand has since August 2009 banned the screening of sexual acts and genitals in films and anything that damages the interests of the country or causes disharmony in the people'. Thunska Pansittivorakul's first film, This Area Is Under Quarantine (2009), which was only screened at this festival last year, was the first victim. Images of a violent conflict between the government and Muslim demonstrators did not get past the censor. How can any film maker still show what is happening in his country? In view of the fact that anything can fall under this law, in Reincarnate he shows for the first time flowing sperm. In his previous films, homosexual love was always prominently, but not explicitly present. Alongside separate sketches of the relationship between pupil and teacher, the film is made up of several cryptic scenes that comment on the oppressive political situation, in which all parties only defend their own interests.\n\n\nA gay love story. A story in the form of a quest. Call it experimental, call it a mixture of documentary and fiction. A very personal film too. It is the director himself who shares his life and feelings with us. Yet it is possibly primarily a political film. The film resists a new law in Thailand that which is going a step further than censorship. Showing certain things (for instance sexual actions) is not only banned, but is also a criminal offence. For a film maker who feels the need to focus on physical passion in his films, there is then a problem. Thunska argues that he would have to give up film making if he could not follow his (artistic and sexual) motivations. A public screening in a cinema in Thailand is out of the question for this film. The film maker would be arrested. It's ironic that the film maker was given the national Silpathorn award by a previous government as being an important Thai artist.\n\n_________________________________\n\nDVDrip\n\nFile Name .........................................: Thunska Pansittivorakul - (2010) Reincarnate.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,174,388,736 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:13:34\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x416 (AR: 1.731)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1963 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.262 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 160 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b3b9fbc8db4ecb5be9ae80f50a511659786d66","amp;dn":"Jutti+AKA+Reincarnate+%28Thunska+Pansittivorakul%2C+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b3b9fbc8db4ecb5be9ae80f50a511659786d66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,179,185,251,200,219,78,203,91,233,174,128,245,10,81,22,89,120,109,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
