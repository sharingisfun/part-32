We are the only creatures on the planet that use symbols in reference to something else. This documentary shows that we use symbols for absolutely everything the mind can conceive of. There is at least one word or icon or gesture to insinuate everything our five senses can detect and then some. But along with this beautiful gift comes a flaw.\n\nMost people are unwilling to seek and create their own interpretations of these symbols. Instead, they blindly submit to preconceived definitions and connotations given by sources unknown. Because of this, many things have been predetermined in our understanding of life without our knowledge. Words can be perverted and used to manipulate rather than to inform. Symbols can be used to segregate rather than unite. And those given the responsibility and authority to disseminate information to the public possess the ability to do with it as they choose.&quot;\n\nPlease share and seed. Thankyou.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6092ca713fad63614b2f18784fb59c5fa16350a5","amp;dn":"Esoteric+Agenda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6092ca713fad63614b2f18784fb59c5fa16350a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,146,202,113,63,173,99,97,75,47,24,120,79,181,156,95,161,99,80,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
