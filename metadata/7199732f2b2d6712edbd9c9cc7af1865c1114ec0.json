It was first published on 4 November 1869.[1] It was ranked the world's most cited by the Science Edition of the 2010 Journal Citation Reports and is widely regarded as one of the few remaining academic journals that publish original research across a wide range of scientific fields.\n\nResearch scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated general public. Towards the front of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying supplementary material on the journal's website.\n\nThere are many fields of scientific research in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in Nature. The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards.\n\nIn 2007 Nature (together with Science) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity.[3][4]\n\nOn October 2012, an Arabic edition of the magazine was launched in partnership with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. As of the time it was released, it had about 10,000 subscribers.[5]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7199732f2b2d6712edbd9c9cc7af1865c1114ec0","amp;dn":"N%D0%B0tur%D0%B5+M%D0%B0g%D0%B0zin%D0%B5+-+April+2014+%28All+Issues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7199732f2b2d6712edbd9c9cc7af1865c1114ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,153,115,47,43,45,103,18,237,189,156,156,199,175,24,101,193,17,78,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
