What was it that roused left wing sympathisers from all over the world to fight for a cause for which their governments would not give active support? In his famous history, Hugh Thomas presents an objective analysis of a conflict - where fascism and democracy, communism and Christianity, centralism and regionalism were all at stake - and which was a much an international civil war as a Spanish one.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Mr. Thomas has understood [the Spanish Civil War] incredibly well and has written it superbly. A full, vivid and deeply serious treatment of a great subject.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œVincent Sheean, The New York Times Book Review\n\n&quot;Stands without rivals as the most balanced and comprehensive book on the subject.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œAmerican Historical Review\n\nFrom the Inside Flap\n\nA masterpiece of the historian's art, Hugh Thomas's The Spanish Civil War remains the best, most engrossing narrative of one of the most emblematic and misunderstood wars of the twentieth century. Revised and updated with significant new material, including new revelations about atrocities perpetrated against civilians by both sides in this epic conflict, this &quot;definitive work on the subject&quot; (Richard Bernstein, The New York Times) has been given a fresh face forty years after its initial publication in 1961. In brilliant, moving detail, Thomas analyses a devastating conflict in which the hopes, dreams, and dogmas of a century exploded onto the battlefield. Like no other account, The Spanish Civil War dramatically reassembles the events that led a European nation, in a continent on the brink of world war, to divide against itself, bringing into play the machinations of Franco and Hitler, the bloodshed of Guernica, and the deeply inspiring heroics of those who rallied to the side of democracy. Communists, anarchists, monarchists, fascists, socialists, democrats -- the various forces of the Spanish Civil War composed a fabric of the twentieth century itself, and Thomas masterfully weaves the diffuse and fascinating threads of the war together in a manner that has established the book as a genuine classic of modern history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2ccccd5982cdc91b52cec6dc0342c54a87c22ae","amp;dn":"The+Spanish+Civil+War+-+Hugh+Thomas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2ccccd5982cdc91b52cec6dc0342c54a87c22ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,204,204,213,152,44,220,145,181,44,236,109,192,52,44,84,168,124,34,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
