But as Richard Dawkins, professor of zoology at Oxford University, demonstrates in this brilliant and eloquent riposte to the Argument from Design, the analogy is false. Natural selection, the unconscious, automatic, blind yet essentially non-random process that Darwin discovered, has no purpose in mind. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind  watchmaker.\n\nPatiently and lucidly, Dr. Dawkins - in this book which has been acclaimed as perhaps the most influential work on evolution written in this century - identifies those aspects of the theory which people find hard to believe and removes the barrier to credibility one by one.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker&lt;/a&gt;\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93bc253ad856fb126d233c4215413f00e616be2f","amp;dn":"Richard+Dawkins+-+The+Blind+Watch+Maker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93bc253ad856fb126d233c4215413f00e616be2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,188,37,58,216,86,251,18,109,35,60,66,21,65,63,0,230,22,190,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
