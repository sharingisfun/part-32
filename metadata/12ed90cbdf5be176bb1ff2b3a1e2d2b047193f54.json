The torrent and data are originally from Myspleen, which is defunct.\n\nApparently, Cartoon Network packaged up some special Space Ghost footage and extras and aired them in cities' science planetariums in the summer of 1996. Someone was able to rip them; I've kept them in their native DAT files, although x264 might crunch the file size down a lot in the hands of an experienced encoder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12ed90cbdf5be176bb1ff2b3a1e2d2b047193f54","amp;dn":"Space+Ghost+1996+Planetarium+Tour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12ed90cbdf5be176bb1ff2b3a1e2d2b047193f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,237,144,203,223,91,225,118,187,31,242,179,161,226,210,176,71,25,63,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
