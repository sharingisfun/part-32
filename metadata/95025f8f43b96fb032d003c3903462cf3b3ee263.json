This means that some episodes are M4A, and some are MP3.\n\nAs the original episodes had a variety of naming and tagging schemes over time, the episodes have all been renamed and re-tagged for consistency. This will be beneficial for future listeners who won't have the benefit of a podcast app doing their organizing for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95025f8f43b96fb032d003c3903462cf3b3ee263","amp;dn":"Enough+-+The+Minimal+Mac+Podcast+-+All+225+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95025f8f43b96fb032d003c3903462cf3b3ee263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,2,95,143,67,185,111,176,50,208,3,195,144,52,98,207,59,62,226,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
