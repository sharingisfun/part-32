Brooklyn Animal Control is not your run-of-the-mill social services agency, and the officers assigned to it are not your average caseworkers... They are a breed apart. These street-hardened veterans negotiate a dangerous secret world in the heart of New York City, one inhabited by werewolves that roam the streets by night, and their human alter-egos who by day infest the hidden back rooms of the criminal elite. Which of their forms is more viscous is open to debate... but both are equally deadly!
