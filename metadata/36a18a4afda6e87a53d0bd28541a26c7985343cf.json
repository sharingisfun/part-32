There are other extended ideas that are in the pipeline.\n\nQuirky6 is a fork of Puppy, but has meandered off on his own quirky direction, becoming substantially different &quot;under the hood&quot;. However, the applications, utilities and user-interface remain much the same as Puppy -- so you have the same ease-of-use, but even a bit easier. Also, you can go to the main Puppy forum and get involved, as you will find their broad agenda embraces such offshoots as Quirky.\n\n\nalso [url]http://bkhome.org/news/?viewDetailed=00042[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a18a4afda6e87a53d0bd28541a26c7985343cf","amp;dn":"quirky-6.1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a18a4afda6e87a53d0bd28541a26c7985343cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,161,138,74,253,166,232,122,83,208,189,40,84,26,38,199,152,83,67,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
