Jet Black is the owner of the Bebop, but has partnered with Spike for his diverse combat skills. Though he is reluctant to admit it, Jet has also come to rely on Spike for companionship in the normally solitary field of bounty hunting. The entire system is open to them via the Gates, but they regularly spend much of their time on Mars, the new hub of human civilization.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f89b6badfdc9b200be7a4769820e4b6d804e4e","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Bebop+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f89b6badfdc9b200be7a4769820e4b6d804e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,248,155,107,173,253,201,178,0,190,122,71,105,130,14,75,109,128,78,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
