(Wiley, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781118694435\r\n\r\nMartin Fleischmann was truly one of the â€˜fathersâ€™ of modern electrochemistry having made major contributions to diverse topics within electrochemical science and technology. These include the theory and practice of voltammetry and in situ spectroscopic techniques, instrumentation, electrochemical phase formation, corrosion, electrochemical engineering, electrosynthesis and cold fusion.\r\n\r\nWhile intended to honour the memory of Martin Fleischmann, Developments in Electrochemistry is neither a biography nor a history of his contributions. Rather, the book is a series of critical reviews of topics in electrochemical science associated with Martin Fleischmann but remaining important today. The authors are all scientists with outstanding international reputations who have made their own contribution to their topic; most have also worked with Martin Fleischmann and benefitted from his guidance.\r\n\r\nEach of the 19 chapters within this volume begin with an outline of Martin Fleischmannâ€™s contribution to the topic, followed by examples of research, established applications and prospects for future developments.\r\n\r\nThe book is of interest to both students and experienced workers in universities and industry who are active in developing electrochemical science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6111d58b3a7c38d546a59a29f0e2cc3a6146ef2e","amp;dn":"Developments+in+Electrochemistry+-+Science+Inspired+by+Martin+Fl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6111d58b3a7c38d546a59a29f0e2cc3a6146ef2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,17,213,139,58,124,56,213,70,165,154,41,240,226,204,58,97,70,239,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
