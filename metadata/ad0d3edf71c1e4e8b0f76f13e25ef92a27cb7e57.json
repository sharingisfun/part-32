Our original treehouse book, The Complete Guide: Build Your Kids a Treehouse, was published in 2007. It exceeded all sales projections right out of the gate and continues to be a leading title in the treehouse category. Now, we've made it even better. The expanded edition features three all-new treehouses shown in complete step by step detail, along with full plans. Also includes an expanded inspiration section, offering a wider variety of unique and interesting treehouses that generate ideas and excitement. Exciting book for parents or grandparents to use with their children.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad0d3edf71c1e4e8b0f76f13e25ef92a27cb7e57","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Guide+to+Treehouses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad0d3edf71c1e4e8b0f76f13e25ef92a27cb7e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,13,62,223,113,193,228,232,176,247,111,19,226,94,249,42,39,203,126,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
