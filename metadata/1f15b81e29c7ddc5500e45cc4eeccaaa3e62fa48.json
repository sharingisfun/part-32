Today only Simon Nicol, whose parents owned the house, is still there from the \noriginal line-up, but the wealth of incredible songs and arrangements left by former \nmembers such as Ashley Hutchings, Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson remains at the core \nof the band's live shows. This concert's highlights include Matty Groves from the band's \nlandmark Liege and Lief album and Sandy Denny's Who Knows Where the Time Goes, voted \n'favourite folk track of all time' by Radio 2 listeners...\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/bQUuz.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/bQUuz.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/hU0Vb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/hU0Vb.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/3Gxkg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/3Gxkg.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n59mn 26s | 694 MiB | 720x400 | 1633 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 256 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.194","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f15b81e29c7ddc5500e45cc4eeccaaa3e62fa48","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Fairport+Convention+45th+Anniversary+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f15b81e29c7ddc5500e45cc4eeccaaa3e62fa48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,21,184,30,41,199,221,197,80,14,69,204,78,236,202,170,62,98,250,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
