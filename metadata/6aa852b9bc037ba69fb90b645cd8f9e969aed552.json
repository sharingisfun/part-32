Humpback whales, Wolves, Salmon, Buffalo, Musk Ox, Bears, Sea lions, Caribou, Bald Eagles, Polar Bears, Moose and Man - just a few of the stars of ALASKA. The variety of life in Alaska is overwhelming - enough to provide material for a score of Big Movies (in fact, it has.) In ALASKA, director George Casey shows real grace whether depicting Humpback whales on a herring hunt or Natives on a whale hunt. The film conveys a consistent spirit of awe and curiosity. Thankfully, ALASKA is not a laundry list of spectacular animals - but a tribute to one of nature&amp;#039;s last purely wild landscapes.\n\nSurvival is the deceptively straightforward theme - strategies for braving Alaska&amp;#039;s extremes and reaping its riches link and distinguish all forms of life here. ALASKA sets the standard for Large Format nature documentaries - too many of which are episodic, derivative and thematically cobbled together. ALASKA&amp;#039;s science is broad, but its best lessons are not meant to be of the classroom variety - sheer exposure to raw and beautiful nature is the point.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: Divx6\nVideo Bitrate: 3200\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384kbps 48kHz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRunTime Per Part: 40\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1000\nRipped by maga998\n\nwww mvgroup org avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa852b9bc037ba69fb90b645cd8f9e969aed552","amp;dn":"IMAX+-+Alaska%3A+Spirit+of+the+Wild+%28Hi-Def%29+%5BDivX-AC3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa852b9bc037ba69fb90b645cd8f9e969aed552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,168,82,185,188,3,123,166,159,185,11,100,92,216,249,233,105,174,213,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
