When Moss arrives, he is accepted as what he appears to be: a somewhat grubby American backpacker on holiday.  Gradually the town begins to realize just who it is they're harboring: a Special Forces soldier turned drugs smuggler.  If that wasn't bad enough, he has a lot of really rough bastards riding into town after him.  The safety of the town and the woman he loves vs. the successful conclusion of a very lucrative drug deal... which will Moss choose?\n\nWritten by Brian Wood and illustrated by Toby Cypress\n\nThis torrent comes with an ADULT rating due to mature language and scenes of violence.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7e3ab3fd15de0d4e48382430d724ac3b27a4f2","amp;dn":"The+Tourist+%28Brian+Wood%29+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7e3ab3fd15de0d4e48382430d724ac3b27a4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,126,58,179,253,21,222,13,78,72,56,36,48,215,36,172,59,39,164,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
