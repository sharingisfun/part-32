Listeners of the show could add their vote by email, counting as a 5th member of the team.  The names of the DJ's were kept secret until the end of the show.\n\nAs WayFM is a Dutch radio station all comments are in Dutch.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f3bc458be947b8577e8849ab57c0683671f68d9","amp;dn":"WayFM+2009-03-19+DJ+Mixcontest+2009+%28Harold+Zwaartman+20h-23h%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f3bc458be947b8577e8849ab57c0683671f68d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,59,196,88,190,148,123,133,119,232,132,154,181,124,6,131,103,31,104,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
