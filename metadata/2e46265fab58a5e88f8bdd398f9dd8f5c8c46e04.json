I started to painstaikingly ripping my old vinyls and this one is rather special. I remember I bought the record becuase I liked the look of the folder... Not all songs stand the test of time, but some are still quite enjoyable. And it is definitive a very rare record, so if you are into vintage synth/electronic/experimental, this is a must have in your collection.\n\nTo RIAA, IFPI and friends: this record can&amp;#039;t be found anywhere but second hand so get off my back - I&amp;#039;m doing you a favour by promoting an interest in music history.\n\nTo fellow music consumers: please let me know what you think about the quality as I might do some more vinyls in the future and I&amp;#039;m still learning analogue signal processing.\n\n/Lucidor\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e46265fab58a5e88f8bdd398f9dd8f5c8c46e04","amp;dn":"Landscape+-+%281981%29+-+From+the+Tea+Rooms+of+Mars...+to+the+Hell+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e46265fab58a5e88f8bdd398f9dd8f5c8c46e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,70,38,95,171,88,165,232,143,139,221,57,143,157,216,245,200,196,110,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
