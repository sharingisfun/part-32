Originally recorded by The Wild Ones in 1965, &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is best known for its 1966 cover by the English band The Troggs, which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1966. The song peaked at one position lower in Britain. As performed by The Troggs, &quot;Wild Thing&quot; is ranked #257 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n    Jimi Hendrix gave one of the most dramatic performances of the song, at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. The performance was captured in the 1967 documentary Monterey Pop. Hendrix recorded the song live, as heard on the compilation album &quot;The Ultimate Experience&quot;. Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the song's finish.\n\n   In 1988, comedian Sam Kinison recorded a novelty version of The Troggs' &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, which appeared on his album &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately?&quot;. The video was a hit on MTV, as it featured cameos of Rodney Dangerfield, as well as many well-known rock musicians, including Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Ratt, Slash and Steven Adler of Guns N' Roses, Billy Idol, Steve Vai, Dweezil Zappa, Richie Sambora, Jon Bon Jovi and Tommy Lee, and a raunchy &quot;roll on the mat&quot; dance with Jessica Hahn.\n                       \n   X is an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1977. The original members are vocalist Exene Cervenka, vocalist/bassist John Doe, guitarist Billy Zoom, and drummer DJ Bonebrake. The band released seven studio albums from 1980 to 1993. After a period of inactivity during the mid to late 1990s, X reunited in the early 2000s, and currently tours. X had released a cover version of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; as a single; in 1989, the song was re-released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the hit film &quot;Major League&quot;. It has since become a staple at sporting events, particularly baseball games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80fca4a9419fbb6939be13ae4f17c04e38874ecb","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+388","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80fca4a9419fbb6939be13ae4f17c04e38874ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,252,164,169,65,159,187,105,57,190,19,174,79,23,192,78,56,135,78,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
