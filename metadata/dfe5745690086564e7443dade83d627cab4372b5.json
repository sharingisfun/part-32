Along with this issue, is included the wonderful 4 cover poster join, combining all 4 covers of the &quot;The End&quot; story-arc (36-39).\n*Note: You can download both or only choose which version you'd prefer by deselecting the one you don't want when you add the torrent to your client software.  If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================\n\n\nAt long last, Gus and Jepperd's long hard journey comes to its bloody and shocking end. Jepperd and Abbot have their final face-off. A death match to the end with the future of Gus and the entire burgeoning hybrid species at risk.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfe5745690086564e7443dade83d627cab4372b5","amp;dn":"Sweet+Tooth+39+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfe5745690086564e7443dade83d627cab4372b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,229,116,86,144,8,101,100,231,68,61,173,232,61,98,124,171,67,114,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
