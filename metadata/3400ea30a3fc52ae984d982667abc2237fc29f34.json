Dave Zirin, one of our great chroniclers of sports and society, spent time on the ground in Brazil interviewing those most affected by the Brazilian World Cup and Olympics, and he comes away with the truth of it all: That the brutal expense of these Mega-events isn't worth the investment of so much public money and historical memory. Everyone who watches the World Cup should read this book.&quot;\n-Grant Wahl, senior writer, Sports Illustrated\n\n&quot;A vision from abroad about our Brazil from inside. It's a vision at once critical, smart, truthful, and free of prejudices, and not sparing any criticisms of his own country, the United States. Additionally it's a generous vision that uplifts the great Brazilian people. Enthusiastically recommended!&quot;\n-Juca Kfouri, columnist, UOL Esporte","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3400ea30a3fc52ae984d982667abc2237fc29f34","amp;dn":"Brazil%27s+Dance+with+the+Devil+-+Dave+Zirin+-+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3400ea30a3fc52ae984d982667abc2237fc29f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,0,234,48,163,252,82,174,152,77,152,38,103,171,194,35,127,194,159,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
