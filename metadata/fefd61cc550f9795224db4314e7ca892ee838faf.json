Shooting in India began on 2 October, with the first leg of the shooting beginning in suburbs of Bombay.\n\nRoute:\n\nBombay - In Bombay, they aimed to beat the efficiency of the dabbawala by using a car instead of a train. The mission fails when Clarkson, in a rush to beat the train, did not take enough cargo, leaving Hammond to carry Clarkson's load as well as his own. Clarkson wins the race against the train, but the train wins the challenge as it has all of its cargo. Hammond accidentally loses and subsequently ruins some of his cargo, and May, trying to take a ring road approach to the station, takes a wrong turn and ends up in the countryside. From there, they take a train to Jaipur.\nJaipur - They host a motorsport challenge with local people and drive to Delhi. In the name of diplomacy, the presenters agree to set times near the top of the leaderboard but not to win; but in the end, Clarkson disregards the promise he made to the other presenters and takes the top of the leaderboard, rendering the event a diplomatic failure.\nDelhi - The mission was to host a trade fair. It is hosted in the exclusive embassy quarter Chanakyapuri and subsequently fails when a massive firework set up by Clarkson goes badly wrong and explodes into the building where the fair was being hosted, which causes the guests to leave, which at first they cannot do because when Hammond parked their cars, he simply threw the keys into a bucket and could not remember whose key was whose.\nAfterwards, they drive into the Himalayan region of Himachal Pradesh past Shimla towards the border with China at Shipki La to test their vehicles on the high terrain and played a game of cricket with local people, using Clarkson's engine to launch the cricket balls into the air. They commented on how their trade missions had been a failure but that the cars selected had tolerated the harsh road conditions they were not designed for. (None of them broke down during the trip and the only problems encountered with the cars were due to either sabotage from the other presenters or due to an attempt to help each other out - in particular when Hammond tried to winch the Rolls-Royce up a hill towards the end, the winch sheared off most of the front of his Mini, though Hammond did fix it near the end) The show finishes by showing the cars left at a hill on plinths with the Union Flag on them.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“\tSo that forevermore people travelling between these two great economic superpowers [India and China] will be reminded that far away there is a small Island called Britain. Great Britain.\nJeremy Clarkson\tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nDuring the final leg of the journey, Jeremy Clarkson played Genesis (particularly the song I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)) out of his loudspeaker, a band that Richard Hammond hates. (a repeat of what he used as a prank in the Middle East special) The crew members names in the credits are given Indian cuisine themes (e.g. Korma Josh Jones) while the out-of-control lawn mower (advertised by May in the trade fair) rolls slowly past.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefd61cc550f9795224db4314e7ca892ee838faf","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+-+%5B17x07%5D+India+Special+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefd61cc550f9795224db4314e7ca892ee838faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,253,97,204,85,15,151,149,34,77,180,49,78,124,168,146,238,131,143,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
