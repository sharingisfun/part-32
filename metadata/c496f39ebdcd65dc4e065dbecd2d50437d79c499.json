It depicts the prosaic life of Roman, a young man living with his grandmother, who uses established institutions for financial gain. As stories go, one day he meets a girl, who is sitting on the &quot;wrong&quot; (i.e. opposite) side of the lecture hall. Later he breaks up with the girl. And then some other stuff happens, but it doesn't really matter that much.\n\nIf you liked the film, check out http://film.sturmankin.eu, where more will follow, and a few already precede. Also posters and postcards are available.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c496f39ebdcd65dc4e065dbecd2d50437d79c499","amp;dn":"Komedianti+AKA+Comedians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c496f39ebdcd65dc4e065dbecd2d50437d79c499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,150,243,158,189,205,101,220,78,6,93,190,205,45,80,67,125,121,196,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
