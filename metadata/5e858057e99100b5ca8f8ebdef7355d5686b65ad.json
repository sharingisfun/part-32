Her voice is clear and sweet, her mandolin playing has been good enough for long enough that she has memories of jamming on-stage with David Grisman and Ricky Skaggs at age twelve, and she plays guitar and clawhammer banjo as well. Oh, and she also writes songs -- really, really good ones. Her debut is not a bluegrass album, though it seems likely that it will end up in that section of the CD store. The songs are all originals, except for covers of the Decemberists\\\\\\' \\\\\\&quot;Shankill Butchers\\\\\\&quot; and Tom Waits\\\\\\' \\\\\\&quot;Come on Up to the House.\\\\\\&quot; Some of her original compositions sound remarkably ancient, such as the vinegary and modal \\\\\\&quot;Tell Me True\\\\\\&quot;; others are bitingly topical, such as \\\\\\&quot;Broussard\\\\\\'s Lament\\\\\\&quot; -- a song that, for all its indirectness, can only be intended as a sharp commentary on the government\\\\\\'s bungling of the rescue and recovery effort following Hurricane Katrina. Her instrumental compositions are complex but sweetly lovely, and her twin-mandolin interplay with Mike Marshall on \\\\\\&quot;Mansinneedof\\\\\\&quot; is especially impressive in both its pleasant accessibility and its mature sophistication. Her acoustic arrangement of \\\\\\&quot;Come on Up to the House\\\\\\&quot; expresses all of the original\\\\\\'s bluesy swagger but tempers it with a more refined sense of Southern hospitality. Truth be told, she comes close to jumping the shark on \\\\\\&quot;Broussard\\\\\\'s Lament.\\\\\\&quot; But if that\\\\\\'s as close as she comes to a misstep on her debut album, then Sarah Jarosz has a long and exceptionally promising career ahead of her. - AMG\n\n-----------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e858057e99100b5ca8f8ebdef7355d5686b65ad","amp;dn":"Sarah+Jarosz+-+Follow+Me+Down+%282011%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e858057e99100b5ca8f8ebdef7355d5686b65ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,133,128,87,233,145,0,181,202,143,142,189,239,115,85,213,104,107,101,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
