Originally released only in the U.K. and Japan, it was not issued in the United States until August 2013. Upon release it received little promotion from Mercury, with no proper single from the album.\nThe album features Nilsson's own recording of &quot;Old Dirt Road&quot;, co-written and performed with John Lennon on Lennon's album Walls and Bridges (1974), Lennon's last album of original songs before his six-year hiatus.\nShortly after the release of this album, Nilsson retired from recording. Though he would subsequently reverse his decision and record various songs for film soundtracks in the 1980s and 1990s, he never issued another full album. (Literally hours before his 1994 death, Nilsson finished recording the final vocal tracks for a planned 'comeback' album, but it has yet to be released.)\nTrack listing[edit]\n\n&quot;Harry&quot; (Eric Idle) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:22 (this track produced by Eric Idle, Trevor Jones, and Andre Jacquemin and sung by Eric Idle and Charlie Dore)\n&quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; (Lowell George, Van Dyke Parks, Martin Fydor Kibbee) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n&quot;Best Move&quot; (Nilsson, Parks, Michael Hazlewood) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n&quot;Old Dirt Road&quot; (Nilsson, John Lennon) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:26\n&quot;I Don't Need You&quot; (Rick L.
