Marguerite Pierry, Jacques Louvigny and Michel Simon each provide a comic performance that surpasses genius, whilst a then comparatively unknown actor Fernandel unleashes his talent on an unsuspecting world.  Although not as noteworthy as RenoirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s later films of the same decade, On purge bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is nonetheless a competently realised comic farce, showing the director at his most joyously unrestrained.  What links this film to Renoir's greater films is its carefree mockery of Bourgeois respectability, and seldom does the French Bourgeoisie come in for more mockery than in this hilariously funny film, all in the worst possible taste. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : On purge bebe.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 699 MiB\n      PlayTime : 46mn 40s\n      Bit rate : 2085 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.49 MiB\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 5\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 46mn 40s\n      Bit rate : 1951 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 544 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.294\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.203\n      StreamSize : 651 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video0 delay : 26ms\n      StreamSize : 41.9 MiB\n      Writing library : Lame 3.96.1\n      Coherency/PlayTime : 6700\n\nIMDB: tt0022223\n\nFrench audio, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by airneck, without the subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6824b75ff56751bfc1a758d1596e6f6a3eaa41d","amp;dn":"Jean+Renoir+-+On+purge+bebe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6824b75ff56751bfc1a758d1596e6f6a3eaa41d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,130,75,117,255,86,117,27,252,26,117,141,21,150,230,246,163,234,164,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
