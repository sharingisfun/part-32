Recorded during a sold-out show at the famous Chicago venue, the album showcases the great back and forth that can happen during a live show, with the band and the crowd playing off one another to create a feedback loop of rock &amp; roll energy. While not a &quot;best-of&quot; album in the classic sense, this kind of spastic, sweat-fueled performance really shows Cage the Elephant at their best, making Live from the Vic in Chicago a live album that works well as both an introduction to the band and as a reminder to longtime fans of what makes this band so fun.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40281beab4b3484b0257ca4c4bf9f80a26bd8e7","amp;dn":"Cage+The+Elephant+-+Live+from+The+Vic+in+Chicago+-+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40281beab4b3484b0257ca4c4bf9f80a26bd8e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,2,129,190,171,75,52,132,176,37,124,164,196,191,159,128,162,107,216,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
