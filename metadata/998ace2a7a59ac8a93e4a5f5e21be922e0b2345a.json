It remains the largest unsolved art heist in history, and Claire Roth, a struggling young artist, is about to discover that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to this crime than meets the eye.\n\nMaking a living reproducing famous artworks for a popular online retailer and desperate to improve her situation, Claire is lured into a Faustian bargain with Aiden Markel, a powerful gallery owner. She agrees to forge a paintingÃ¢â‚¬â€a Degas masterpiece stolen from the Gardner MuseumÃ¢â‚¬â€in exchange for a one-woman show in his renowned gallery. But when that very same long-missing Degas painting is delivered to ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s studio, she begins to suspect that it may itself be a forgery.\n\nHer desperate search for the truth leads Claire into a labyrinth of deceit where secrets hidden since the late nineteenth century may be the only evidence that can now save her life.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                              Published - October 23rd 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:998ace2a7a59ac8a93e4a5f5e21be922e0b2345a","amp;dn":"The+Art+Forger+by+B.+A.+Shapiro+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"998ace2a7a59ac8a93e4a5f5e21be922e0b2345a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,138,206,42,122,89,172,138,147,228,165,245,226,27,233,34,224,178,52,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
