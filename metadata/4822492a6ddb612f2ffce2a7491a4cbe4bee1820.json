Being too busy to catch 40 winks is one thing, but if you lie in bed staring at the ceiling, hoping and praying that your eyes will close eventually but just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it, you may need a homeopathic cure for insomnia. \n\nWhy go this route? Because it is not just safer than prescribed medications for sleeplessness, but it has also proven to be more effective in the long term whereby it is less addictive and less dangerous when applied. \n\nBefore we go any further, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s define what we mean by homeopathic. People often make the mistake of thinking that homeopathic means taking pills made from plants, however, though this may make up part of a homeopathic or naturopathic treatment plan, it is not the only form of treatment. A cure for insomnia then could be a combination of melatonin tablets, acupuncture and even placing lavender under your pillow at night. It is really the combination of these activities that makes a homeopathic plan effective. \n\nThink about the last time you looked for a cure for insomnia. Did you rush off to your General Practitioner and beg for sleeping tablets to help you sleep? Did you cut out all the caffeine and sugar from your diet, hoping that this would eventually keep you from struggling with sleep at night? Perhaps you might have even considered seeing a homeopath, and changed your mind at the last minute. \n\nThere are many negative connotations surrounding natural methods of healing for sleeplessness, and this may seem strange to many people who have tried them, and found them to be exactly what was needed for them to get to sleep fast. This negativity is inspired in part by the belief that naturopathic methods involve crystals and chanting, and are used only by so-called Ã¢â‚¬ËœhippiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which require you to believe in them, before they show any signs of curing your insomnia. \n\nIf you were to ask doctors their opinion on these natural methods of dealing with diseases and day-to-day problems, they would probably agree that these methods, in combination with a more formal treatment plan, could really work. After all, if you consider the basis for any type of medicine such as pills and potions, they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t begin by being made commercially in labs until the 1940s and 50s. Before that time, people relied heavily on the healing power of natural herbs for sleep. Ipecac was given to relieve nausea while white willow bark was found to be an effective headache soother. And as for a cure for insomnia, many physicians thought it is wise to prescribe soothing baths with infusions of lavender to relax the body and mind, and inspire a high quality sleep when needed. \n\nIf this is the case, why are we so quick to dismiss the merits of these powerful cures for insomnia today? It would seem as though that people are frightened to try anything they do not understand and because a homeopathic doctor does not necessarily have a degree on his or her wall, people are afraid to put their health into the hands of these natural healers. But when you are exhausted, struggling night after night with sleeplessness, why not try this type of natural cure for insomnia? It may work or it may not, but it will definitely not harm you in any way possible.\n\nEthan Chong is a past insomniac who has always been on the lookout for new insomnia cures.
