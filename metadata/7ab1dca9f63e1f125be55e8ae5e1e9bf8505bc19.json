When Joanne's son  \n                    Jamie gets bullied, she assumes that his  \n                    Catholic school will do everything they can to  \n                    help. She is shocked to discover, though, that  \n                    he is being attacked because the other children  \n                    think he's gay. Headteacher Mr Georgeson runs a  \n                    tight ship, but although he says he abhors  \n                    bullying, he can't condone homosexuality.  \n                    Joanne's husband Dave tells her to keep her  \n                    nose out, as she'll make it worse, and that  \n                    Jamie'll grow out of it. But things are much  \n                    worse for Jamie than anyone realises, and if  \n                    the school and his parents don't support him,  \n                    will Jamie be pushed to desperate measures?  \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab1dca9f63e1f125be55e8ae5e1e9bf8505bc19","amp;dn":"Moving.On.S02E08.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab1dca9f63e1f125be55e8ae5e1e9bf8505bc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,177,220,169,246,62,31,18,91,229,94,138,229,225,233,191,133,5,188,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
