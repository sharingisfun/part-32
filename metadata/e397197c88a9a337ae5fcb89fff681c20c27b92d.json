To feed and sustain this projected population, world food production must increase by at least 50 percent on much of the same land that we farm today. To meet this staggering challenge, scientists must develop the technology required to achieve an evergreen revolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one that increases crop productivity without degrading natural resources.\n\nWith 30 percent new material, the updated and revised third edition of Growth and Mineral Nutrition of Field Crops covers all aspects of crop growth and mineral nutrition that contribute to sustainable, high-yield agriculture. Bringing together international scientific knowledge of crop production and the impacts of agriculture on the environment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e397197c88a9a337ae5fcb89fff681c20c27b92d","amp;dn":"Growth+and+Mineral+Nutrition+of+Field+Crops","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e397197c88a9a337ae5fcb89fff681c20c27b92d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,151,25,124,136,169,163,55,174,95,203,137,255,246,129,194,12,39,185,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
