It was a brash claim, but if anyone in blues history could stand ... Full Descriptionup to this bit of bravura, Dixon was the man. Over the course of his career, he penned a suitcase full of tunes that defined Chicago blues--easily the most influential strand of the blues in the post-war era.\n\nThis 1971 live set--apparently recorded for a radio broadcast from a club in Long Beach California--finds him in fine form, backed by some younger Chicago musicians, including Carey Bell on harp and none other than Butch Dixon (a relation, of course) on piano. Dixon, who sounds like he's having a terrific time, lectures the highly appreciative crowd about the history of the blues and serves up fine versions of his classics &quot;Built for Comfort&quot; and &quot;Rock Me.&quot;\n\nRecorded live in Long Beach, California in 1971.\n\n\n1.
