Well, that depends on how simple youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to go. Just because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stuck in Excel all day doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do some questing. Arena.Xlsm is a role-playing game you can play in Microsoft Excel, and it works better than you would expect.\n\nArena.Xlsm is a project by accountant and MBA Candidate Cary Walkin. The game is really just a step above text-based, with a small arena for combat that is 14 x 19 cells in size. To the right of the arena are your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stats, movement controls, and action buttons. There is also a panel that tells you what kind of monster youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re currently facing down. This is important because all the beasts you slay in Arena.Xlsm are represented by punctuation marks. I know that looks like two brackets sliding across the screen, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a scary dragon.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got ranged attacks, melee, and magic spells at your disposal. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually quite surprising how in-depth this game is for something that runs entirely inside Excel. There are item drops, experience points, character levels, and adjustable stats. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even encounter boss battles every few levels. Many of the variables for items and creatures are randomly generated, so each playthrough is a little different.\n\nArena.Xlsm can be downloaded for free, and is just under 1MB in size. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protected, so you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go around modifying the game yourself. It has been tested in Excel 2007 and 2010 on Windows. Walkin suggests Microsoft Office 2013 should work fine, but this hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been confirmed yet. This game will not, however, run on a Mac. Even when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only an Excel-based RPG, the Mac just isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t good for gaming. Bummer.\n\nDownload Arena.Xlsm if you dare.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.geek.com/games/turn-your-excel-spreadsheet-into-an-rpg-with-arena-xlsm-1544051/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a5869400b3c92afce0b0a70f7622f8381c4e7b2","amp;dn":"Arena.xlsm+v1.0+Excel+Spreadsheet+RPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a5869400b3c92afce0b0a70f7622f8381c4e7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,88,105,64,11,60,146,175,206,11,10,112,247,98,47,131,129,196,231,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
