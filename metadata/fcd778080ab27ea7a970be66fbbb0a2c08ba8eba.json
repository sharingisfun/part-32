It constitutes a harmonic mixture of control theory and applications, which makes the book especially useful for graduate students, practicing engineers and researchers interested in modeling and control of processes. This well written and easily understandable book includes a broad spectrum of methods for the analysis and design of control systems in a very thorough way. The book includes solved multitude of practical applications, examples, exercises and unsolved problems at the end of each chapter as well as Matlab tools which are freely available at the web page of the book. 'This is an impressive book really worth to be published. I do not know of any modern textbook including such a broad spectrum of classical and modern methods for analysis and synthesis of control systems not being represented superficially but very thoroughly' Heinz Unbehauen, Bochum University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd778080ab27ea7a970be66fbbb0a2c08ba8eba","amp;dn":"Process+Modelling%2C+Identification%2C+and+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd778080ab27ea7a970be66fbbb0a2c08ba8eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,215,120,8,10,178,126,167,169,112,190,102,251,187,10,44,8,186,142,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
