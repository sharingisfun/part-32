The screenplay was written by Robert Dozier, based on the novel by Henry Morton Robinson. The film was shot on location in Boston, Rome and Vienna. The film's music score was written by Jerome Moross.\n\nRobinson's original 1950 novel was based on the life of Cardinal Francis Spellman, who was then archbishop of New York. The Vatican's liaison officer for the film was Joseph Ratzinger, later to become Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe film shows the life of a fictional Irish American, Roman Catholic priest, Stephen Fermoyle, played by Tom Tryon, from his ordination in 1917 to his appointment as a cardinal on the eve of World War II. Fermoyle goes through one crisis after another, first in his own family and then as he climbs up the ladder of the church hierarchy back in his Boston parish and later in Rome within the Vatican. The film touches on various social issues such as interfaith marriage, sex outside of marriage, abortion, racial bigotry, the rise of fascism, and war.\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\\\| '_ \\\\/ __| '_ \\\\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\\\__ \\\\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\\\____\\\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\\\__,_|\\\\___|\\\\__, |_| |_|\\\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\\\| '_ ` _ \\\\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
