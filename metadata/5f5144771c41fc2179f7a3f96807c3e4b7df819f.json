Brittany says she lives in fear of her ex-boyfriend and father of her 13-month-old son every day. She claims Frank was abusive throughout their one-year relationship, and that during one instance when she was four months pregnant, he assaulted her, trapped her in a car and headed for Mexico, while telling her that she would never see her family and friends again. After the alleged incident, she says she left him, and now fears he will snatch their son and leave the country. Are the courts failing to protect Brittany and her son? Frank admits he has a temper but says heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never laid a hand on Brittany. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been eight months since heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seen his son because he says heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s afraid her false allegations will land him in jail, so he stays away. Will Brittany allow Frank to have a supervised visit with the boy? Then, a heartbreaking story that will leave you speechless: Tisha says when she divorced her abusive husband, she never imagined how heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d retaliate. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a tragedy no mother should have to endure -- could it have been prevented? DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t miss the child custody precautions every mother needs to know before leaving an abusive relationship!
