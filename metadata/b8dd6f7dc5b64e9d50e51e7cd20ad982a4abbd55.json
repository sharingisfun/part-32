Nick\n\nResized from a 720p version. Good Quality. No subtitles.\n\n\nNick is desperately in love with Franky, but it's a one-way street. He has no choice but to accept Franky as his friend and nothing more, while his love for her grows with each passing day. Then Matty gets in touch. He's still in love with Franky and needs Nick's help to get him out of Morocco and back to Bristol. Ever loyal, Nick tries to put his feelings for Franky aside and agrees to help his brother. Torn between his love for Franky, his loyalty to Matty and his fear of confrontation, Nick's life begins to spin wildly out of control until he has no choice but to\nstep up and discover what he's truly capable of. \n\n// TPCNOGO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8dd6f7dc5b64e9d50e51e7cd20ad982a4abbd55","amp;dn":"Skins.S06e06.Nick.HDTV.TPCNOGO.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8dd6f7dc5b64e9d50e51e7cd20ad982a4abbd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,221,111,125,197,182,78,157,80,229,30,124,210,10,217,130,164,171,189,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
