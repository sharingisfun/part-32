The duo consists of Kamile Gudmonaite and Mantas Zemleckas, two young multi-instrumentalists who draw their inspiration from both Lithuanian folk music and world music with a twist of indie pop. Didgeridoo, Jew's harp, melodica, kazoo, berimbau and the one and only Ã¢â‚¬Å“KamiliphoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Mantas' present to Kamile) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ these are only few of the instruments that Kamaniu Silelis uses to perform their quirky songs.\n\nStarted in 2011, the duo has already attracted a lot of followers. Four of their DIY videos have received over 20,000 views on YouTube each, the number of their Facebook fans has recently reached 3,000. This year Kamaniu Silelis released their long-awaited debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Viskas tekaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything FlowsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), which received favorable reviews. One of the critics suggested that Kamaniu Silelis is the band that should be shown to those foreign listeners who are interested in hearing unique Lithuanian music: Ã¢â‚¬Å“They sing in Lithuanian, but their lyrics sound mesmerizing even to those who don't understand this language.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBoth Kamile and Mantas also are active participants in the local theater scene. Kamile is studying theatre directing at the Lithuanian academy of music and theatre and Mantas is studying acting at the same academy. Sometimes they work with plays together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kamile as a director, Mantas as an actor.\n\nKamaniu Silelis live and create in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, but this year they are ready to hit the road and present their music to those international listeners who share the duo's love for folk sounds, the beauty of nature and caring for each other.\n\n\n\nContacts\nManager Tomas Ivanauskas, +370 657 52 502,\nSupport artists by purchasing this album: http://cdbaby.com/cd/kamaniusilelis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234bf501bd526a4003cfcb100eb62b611d126292","amp;dn":"KAMANIU+SILELIS%3A+Viskas+Teka+%282014%3B+WEB+Album%3B+MP3%3B+VBR-CBR320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234bf501bd526a4003cfcb100eb62b611d126292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,75,245,1,189,82,106,64,3,207,203,16,14,182,43,97,29,18,98,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
