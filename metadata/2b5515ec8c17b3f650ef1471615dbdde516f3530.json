The album was a commercial success, reached #2 on both the UK Album Chart and the Billboard 200, selling 4 million units in the US as of January 2008 . The album also received a Gold accreditation in Australia during 2005\n\nFrom Amazon.co.uk Review By Kevin Maidment - Despite the photographic presence of an acoustic guitar (the rock &amp; roll equivalent of a rubber bullet), the enviably lovely hair and the unassuming knitwear, Sheryl Crow is staring back at us from the cover of The Very Best Of with her chin resting on a fist clenched tightly with white-knuckled defiance. This is, after all, the girl whose wishful thinking led her to sing &quot;All I wanna do is have some fun&quot; while privately preferring to either curl up in bed for a very long time or roll over and die (she's recently come out of the closet with regards to her longstanding battles with depression). Yes, she's earned herself an armful of Grammys and has been damned with faint praise, but if you go easy on the relatively troublesome second half of Sheryl Crow's 10-year solo career (the poppy optimism of songs like &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; and &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; seems strained), then this decade-acknowledging resumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© serves as a reminder of her narrative talents for summarising the pitfalls of burdensome workloads (&quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot;) and problematic squeezes (&quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot;) within an MTV-friendly pop framework.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] All I Wanna Do\n[02] Soak Up The Sun\n[03] My Favorite Mistake\n[04] The First Cut Is The Deepest\n[05] Everyday Is A Winding Road\n[06] Leaving Las Vegas\n[07] Strong Enough\n[08] Light In Your Eyes\n[09] If It Makes You Happy\n[10] Run Baby Run\n[11] Picture\t&gt; And Kid Rock\n[12] C'mon, C'mon\t&gt; Featuring The Corrs\n[13] A Change Would Do You Good\n[14] Home\n[15] There Goes The Neighborhood\n[16] I Shall Believe\n[17] Let's Get Free [Bonus Track]\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:17m:46s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 525mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 04 November 2003\nRecord Company\t&gt; A&amp;M Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt;[All I Wanna Do]\n&gt;[If It Makes You Happy]\n&gt;[The First Cut Is The Deepest]\n&gt;[Everyday Is A Winding Road]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[1999] Sweet Child O' Mine [CDS] - Sheryl Crow\n\n[01] Sweet Child O' Mine\n[02] If It Makes You Happy\n[03] A Change Would Do You Good\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[2002] Soak Up The Sun [CDS]  - Sheryl Crow\n\n[01] Soak Up The Sun\n[02] Chances Are\n[03] You're Not The One\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[2004] Light In Your Eyes [CDS] - Sheryl Crow\n\n[01] Light In Your Eyes\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; http://www.sherylcrow.com \n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Crow \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/c/crow.html \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/sherylcrow \n&gt;\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b5515ec8c17b3f650ef1471615dbdde516f3530","amp;dn":"%5B2003%5D+The+Very+Best+Of+-+Sheryl+Crow+748mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b5515ec8c17b3f650ef1471615dbdde516f3530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,85,21,236,140,23,179,246,80,239,20,113,97,93,189,222,81,111,53,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
