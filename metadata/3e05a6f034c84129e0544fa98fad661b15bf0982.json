Or in Jimmy's case? You start looking for a crash. He and Papo join forces with Gorky's crew to pull off the biggest insurance scam of their lives. But with the new investigator on their tail, Lionel in tow and a trigger happy Kazimir running the show, it won't be easy. Meanwhile Lucia's suspicions escalate. Is it her imagination or is Jimmy a little too friendly with that colleague at work?\n\nThe series airs on Showcase Canada.\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is not as good as a scene release due to my capture and encoding methods it is quite watchable in my opinion.\n\n\nSeries Info: Described as a cross between The Office and The Sopranos by the show's creator, Malcolm MacRury (ZOS: Zone of Separation, Deadwood), Cra$h &amp; Burn follows Jimmy Burn, a young claims adjuster for a cut-throat, bottom-line insurance corporation. Jimmy maneuvers his way around insurance scams and the criminal underworld as he tries to escape his past and make a better life on the gritty post-industrial streets of Hamilton.\n\nCra$h &amp; Burn stars Luke Kirby (Tell Me You Love Me, Slings and Arrows) as Jimmy Burn, the cocky yet charming up-and-comer looking to claim a piece of the corporate pie as an insurance adjuster. Casting also features Leela Savasta (Battlestar Galactica, Intelligence) as Lucia Silva, Jimmy's live-in girlfriend; Caroline Cave (The L Word, This Beautiful City) as Catherine Scott, a shrewd yet practical in-house insurance lawyer; Clark Johnson (The Wire, Homicide: Life on the Street, also an Emmy-nominated director on The Shield) as Walker Hearn, a veteran insurance investigator and Steve Bacic (The Guard, Andromeda) as Korkov, a conman and Mafioso hustling to scam the system.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e05a6f034c84129e0544fa98fad661b15bf0982","amp;dn":"Crash.%26.Burn.S01E10.Busmans.Holiday.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e05a6f034c84129e0544fa98fad661b15bf0982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,5,166,240,52,200,65,41,224,84,79,169,143,173,102,27,21,191,9,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
