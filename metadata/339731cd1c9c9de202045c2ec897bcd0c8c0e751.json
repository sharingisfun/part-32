I was at this show, one of the few Hornsby-era shows I caught, and I remember being very impressed with the new sound, and surprised by the setlist.  \n\nA lot of people were predicting the second verse of Dark Star, no dice.  But the C.C. Rider -&gt; Train To Cry in the first set was just breathtaking.  Kicked my ass.  A hot and mysterious West L.A. Fadeaway also got the boat rocking.  \n\nI figured we'd probably get a China -&gt; Rider to start the second set and an Other One out of Drumz, the expected.  I was not predicting three first set songs in the pre-drums segment and a rare (for me) China Doll.  \n\nThis show definitely stands out. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339731cd1c9c9de202045c2ec897bcd0c8c0e751","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1991-08-18+-+Shoreline+Amp+in+Mountainview%2C+CA++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339731cd1c9c9de202045c2ec897bcd0c8c0e751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,151,49,205,28,156,157,226,2,4,92,46,200,151,188,208,200,192,231,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
