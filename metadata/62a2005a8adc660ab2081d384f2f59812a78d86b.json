He recognizes lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cycle and death amidst the natural beauty and plentiful bounty of nature Ã¢â‚¬â€ A certain mystery and sadness, the inevitability and law that out of what seemingly ends, come the pleasant things of this world. Throughout the journey, the reader is reminded of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delicate balance or as Sashko, the young boy, witnesses, the negative abundance of things: Riding a hay-filled wagon about to tip over is unpleasant. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unpleasant to look at a large fire, but pleasant to look at its embers. How pleasant it is to hug a foal. Or at daybreak to see your calf wandering in all by itself, to know it found its way home in the dark. I loved thunder, although it scared Mother, the downpour and loud wind for the gifts they brought to the orchard.\n\nTranslated into English by Anatole Bilenko.\n\n75 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62a2005a8adc660ab2081d384f2f59812a78d86b","amp;dn":"Oleksandr+Dovzhenko.+The+enchanted+Desna+%281982%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62a2005a8adc660ab2081d384f2f59812a78d86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,162,0,90,138,220,102,10,178,8,29,56,79,47,89,129,42,120,216,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
