And we know that another global disaster is eventually headed our way. Can we survive it? How?\n \nAs a species, Homo sapiens is at a crossroads. Study of our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turbulent past suggests that we are overdue for a catastrophic disaster, whether caused by nature or by human interference.\n ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a frightening prospect, as each of the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past major disastersÃ¢â‚¬â€from meteor strikes to bombardment by cosmic radiationÃ¢â‚¬â€resulted in a mass extinction, where more than 75 percent of the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s species died out. But in Scatter, Adapt, and Remember, Annalee Newitz, science journalist and editor of the science Web site io9.com explains that although global disaster is all but inevitable, our chances of long-term species survival are better than ever. Life on Earth has come close to annihilationÃ¢â‚¬â€humans have, more than once, narrowly avoided extinction just \nduring the last million yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€but every single time a few creatures survived, evolving to adapt to the harshest of conditions. \nThis brilliantly speculative work of popular science focuses on humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long history of dodging the bullet, as well as on new threats that we may face in years to come. Most important, it explores how scientific breakthroughs today will help us avoid disasters tomorrow. From simulating tsunamis to studying central TurkeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancient underground cities; from cultivating cyanobacteria for Ã¢â‚¬Å“living citiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to designing space elevators to make space colonies cost-effective; from using math to stop pandemics to studying the remarkable survival strategies of gray whales, scientists and researchers the world over are discovering the keys to long-term resilience and learning how humans can choose life over death.\n NewitzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable and fascinating journey through the science of mass extinctions is a powerful argument about human ingenuity and our ability to change. In a world populated by doomsday preppers and media commentators obsessively forecasting our demise, Scatter, Adapt, and Remember is a compelling voice of hope. It leads us away from apocalyptic thinking into a future where we live to build a better worldÃ¢â‚¬â€on this planet and perhaps on others. Readers of this book will be equipped scientifically, intellectually, and emotionally to face whatever the future holds.\n\n2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67f8e6a89ae7a6dade5099fb794ceb320674821","amp;dn":"Scatter%2C+Adapt%2C+and+Remember%3A+How+Humans+Will+Survive+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67f8e6a89ae7a6dade5099fb794ceb320674821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,127,142,106,137,174,122,109,173,229,9,159,183,148,206,179,32,103,72,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
