Original members Mike Nichols and Elaine May after honing their talents with the Playwrights Theatre went on to superb careers, May on Broadway and Nichols in Hollywood where he directed such classic films as The Graduate and Who&amp;#039;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Dubbed &quot;the world&amp;#039;s fastest humans&quot; for their whip-smart, lightning-fast lines, Nichols and May are funny, but they are stunning when you realize their sketches were unscripted. Entirely improvised, this collection of 12 of their best efforts showcases their superb timing and ability to develop character depth. Alternating straight and set-up roles, they take the audience in one direction and then suddenly change directions with amusing results. Able to assume accents and characters like a second skin, Nichols and May are the real thing, amusing, acerbic, and clever, and this album is a thing of comedic history. \n\n01  Telephone                                8:13  \n02  Adultery                                 7:52  \n03  Disc Jockey                              9:06  \n04  Mother and Son                           6:33  \n05  A Little More Gauze                      3:34  \n06  Morning Rounds                           1:42  \n07  Merry Christmas, Doctor                  3:43  \n08  Physical                                 5:11  \n09  Cocktail Piano                           4:41  \n10  Bach to Bach                             5:31  \n11  Second Piano Concerto (The Dentist)      5:02  \n12  Nichols and May at Work                  4:30  \n\n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f639dd9a15cb0d6d3098d66f70738a735b3c5c14","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Nichols+%26+May+-+In+Retrospect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f639dd9a15cb0d6d3098d66f70738a735b3c5c14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,57,221,154,21,203,13,109,48,152,214,111,112,115,138,115,91,60,92,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
