Tracks 1-12 are from the CD, plus I included a couple of audio clips I took from the film that most fans think should have been included on the soundtrack. Track 13 is &quot;The Teddy Bear&amp;#039;s Picnic&quot; as sung by Debra Messing (Beth) and Track 14 is...wait for it...&quot;The Magical Elf Song&quot; as sung by Ashton Kutcher (Elliot). ;) Album cover art is also included.
