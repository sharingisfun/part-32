It is something of a return to the roots for the band. Rabbit Don't Come Easy combines many old classic Helloween elements with newer sounds and a modern production.\n\nNo drummer is listed in the band line-up for this album. Mark Cross was hired for the position before recording, but only managed to complete two tracks (&quot;Don't Stop Being Crazy&quot; and &quot;Listen to The Flies&quot;) before being forced to leave due to illness. Mikkey Dee of MotÃƒÂ¶rhead played on the rest of the songs on a session basis.\n\nReleased - 2003\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t \t\n1. \t&quot;Just a Little Sign&quot;   \t \t4:26\n2. \t&quot;Open Your Life&quot;   \t \t4:30\n3. \t&quot;The Tune&quot;   \t        \t5:35\n4. \t&quot;Never Be A Star&quot;   \t \t4:10\n5. \t&quot;Liar&quot;   \t        \t4:55\n6. \t&quot;Sun 4 The World&quot;   \t \t3:57\n7. \t&quot;Don't Stop Being Crazy&quot;   \t4:21\n8. \t&quot;Do You Feel Good&quot;   \t\t4:22\n9. \t&quot;Hell Was Made In Heaven&quot;   \t5:33\n10. \t&quot;Back Against The Wall&quot;   \t5:44\n11. \t&quot;Listen To The Flies&quot;   \t4:54\n12. \t&quot;Nothing To Say&quot;   \t \t8:27\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6159eb3e10e08459c09a7f563f6978f794561487","amp;dn":"Helloween+-+Rabnt+Come+Easy+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6159eb3e10e08459c09a7f563f6978f794561487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,89,235,62,16,224,132,89,192,154,127,86,63,105,120,247,148,86,20,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
