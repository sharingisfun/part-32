There are no mp3&amp;#039;s included, simply because I don&amp;#039;t have them and because that would blow the filesize to infinity and beyond. \n\nTo play with these Songs you have to acquire the mp3&amp;#039;s on a [...] way and you need Ultrastar or a compatible program. I recommend the new &quot;Ultrastar Deluxe&quot;, you can find it on sourceforge.net .\n\nI dont think that I can include the whole list of songs here, so in the torrent is beside the unprotected archive a simple textfile with a full list of all songs included in the archive.\n\nI packed all the files because Windows has many troubles with &gt;2600 files and I don&amp;#039;t think that any BitTorrent-Client is able to handle so much damn small files. \n\nI am sorry that I can only seed with max. 40 KB/s, but I will try to spread it to a few friends so that it will be easily available And the archive is only ~5 MB so it won&amp;#039;t take long anyhow to spread it.\n\nIf you are looking for more songs visit these sites:\n\n+ http://ssx.ss.funpic.de/index.php?file=All [one of the main sources of this release ~2300 songs]\n+ http://www.ussongs.de.vu/ [a smaller site, but still good ~1700 songs]\n+ http://pcsingstar.com/forum/ [a new, but very good size ~1200 songs]\n\nIf you wonder why the sum of the three sites are way over 2600 its because there are many doubles and I tried to filter them out as good as I can, still there are some left, excuse me for this. \n\nSo, hope you like this and I will seed for as long as I can.\nSpread it...\n\nyoless","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92525bc42137cef91e21a3ac630d537f6c1af60c","amp;dn":"approx.+2600+Ultrastar+Songs+%5Bonly+txt%5D+%5BRESEED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92525bc42137cef91e21a3ac630d537f6c1af60c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,82,91,196,33,55,206,249,30,33,163,172,99,13,83,127,108,26,246,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
