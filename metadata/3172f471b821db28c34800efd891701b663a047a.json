These tracks were never released and sadly the masters have not survived. \n\nCamera played live extensively at this time and they soldiered on into 1985 with a 4-piece line up (Gary Scargill and Rob Gospel were added) and the Quartet formed Paradise Now in '86. Nigel left in '87 and was replaced by Steve Wright from &quot;Fiat Lux&quot;. Sadly the Band ended there. However, Camera Obscura never actually split up.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST:\nA1 Escape From The City\t3:50\t\nA2 Horizons Of Suburbia\t5:23\t\nA3 The Mandarin Man 4:17\t\nA4 Fever Pitch 3:39\t\nA5 Vincent Van Gogh 3:21\t\nB1 Destitution 5:27\t\nB2 Circular Waves 4:30\t\nB3 Scarlet Vixen 4:37\t\nB4 Mystery Box 3:18\t\nB5 Race In Athens 6:50\n\nCREDITS\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mark Boyce (tracks: A4, A5, B4)\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Ferguson (tracks: B2)\nKeyboards, Guitar, Programmed By, Backing Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Oldroyd\nProducer, Mixed By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Camera Obscura\nVocals, Percussion, Trumpet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nigel James\nWritten-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ James, Oldroyd\nArtwork By [Design] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hannah Chilton, Keith Beaumont\nBacking Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Marlene Oldroyd (tracks: A5)\nCo-producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Ferguson, Phil Brown","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3172f471b821db28c34800efd891701b663a047a","amp;dn":"Camera+Obscura+-+Horizons+of+Suburbia+%5B1983%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3172f471b821db28c34800efd891701b663a047a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,114,244,113,184,33,219,40,195,72,0,239,216,145,112,27,102,58,4,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
