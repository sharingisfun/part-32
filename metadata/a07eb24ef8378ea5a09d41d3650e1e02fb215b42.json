Water boils at sea level at 212Â°. In Denver, where the air is much lighter,it boils at 202Â°.\r\nTherefore, it does not reach as great a heat and boiling requires a longer time. It has been the wish to make the recipes practical and easily followed by the most inexperienced cooks.\r\nShe has not attempted giving much information on chemistry and food values, leaving that for the cooking schools. No girl's education is complete without such a course. An intelligent knowledge of cooking will enable them to feed their family with less expense and giving them the variety the family requires.\r\nFood for invalids should be selected and cooked with the greatest care. A chapter is devoted to that kind of cooking. Scientific cooking should fill an important part in the training of a nurse.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nBreads 9\r\nBreads with Baking Powder 20\r\nGriddle Cakes 26\r\nCereals 29\r\nSoups 30\r\nCream Soups 39\r\nSummer Soups 47\r\nFruit Soups 47\r\nFish 49\r\nShell Fish 57\r\nLobsters 64\r\nMeats 67\r\nPork 77\r\nMutton and Lamb 82\r\nVeal 87\r\nPoultry 94\r\nGame 108\r\nEntrees 114\r\nFritters 138\r\nVegetables 141\r\nSauces 169\r\nPuddings and Ice Cream Sauces 180\r\nCheese Dishes 186\r\nSalads 191\r\nEggs 215\r\nSandwiches 225\r\nCanapes 231\r\nPastry 234\r\nHot Puddings 244\r\nCold Desserts 264\r\nFrozen Desserts 282\r\nSherbets 283\r\nPunches 286\r\nIce Creams 289\r\nSauces for Ice Cream 296\r\nMousses 298\r\nParfaits 299\r\nCakes 304\r\nFillings for Layer Cake 329\r\nIcings for Cakes 332\r\nGingerbread, Doughnuts, Cookies and Cream Puffs 335\r\nCompotes, Preserving, Jellies and Pickles 339\r\nPreserving 341\r\nCanning 344\r\nJams or Marmalades 346\r\nJellies 347\r\nPickles 348\r\nCandies 355\r\nBeverages 359\r\nInvalid Cookery 366\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/bs7w7fws5/The_Rocky_Mountain_Cook_Book.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07eb24ef8378ea5a09d41d3650e1e02fb215b42","amp;dn":"The+Rocky+Mountain+Cook+Book+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07eb24ef8378ea5a09d41d3650e1e02fb215b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,126,178,78,248,55,142,165,160,157,65,211,101,14,30,2,251,33,91,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
