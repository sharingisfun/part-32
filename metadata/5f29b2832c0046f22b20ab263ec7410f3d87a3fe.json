Feet In The Sea Head In The Stars\n\nDescribed on his Myspace page as Ã¢â‚¬ËœJohn Martyn meets Nick Drake for the 21st CenturyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Dan Arborise certainly has the strung out, jazzy tendencies of the former when it comes to his guitar playing and even a touch of the vocal fragility of the latter.\nLyrically, Ã¢â‚¬ËœOf Tide And TrailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a collection of meditations on life, death and fatherhood. Fine though they are, however, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the words that are the principal concern. The woozy drone of one man and his guitar may not seem like anything particularly noteworthy, but this is a hugely atmospheric record thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gently beguiling, with picked acoustic guitar layered to create ambient swathes of sound that engage the head and melt the heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f29b2832c0046f22b20ab263ec7410f3d87a3fe","amp;dn":"Dan+Arborise+-+Of+Tide+%26amp%3B+Trail+%5B2009%5D%5BFLAC+%2F+24bit+Lossless%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f29b2832c0046f22b20ab263ec7410f3d87a3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,41,178,131,44,0,70,242,43,32,171,38,62,199,65,15,61,135,163,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
