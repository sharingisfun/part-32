Beware amalgam dental fillings!  They may soon (hopefully) be banned for use in all civilized countries.\n\nThe two center pieces here are the TV documentaries &quot;Is there poison in your mouth,&quot; aired by 60 Minutes on CBS in 1990 (25 minutes) and &quot;Poison in the Mouth,&quot; aired by Panorama on the BBC in 1994 (38 minutes).\n\nThe other three videos are two short previews and a brief introduction to the subject of mercury neurotoxicity released by the University of Calgary.  The previews are for two documentaries which you can purchase at www.lammag.com, &quot;Quecksilber - The Strange Story of Dental Amalgam&quot; and &quot;Rooted&quot; about the dangers of root canals.\n\nThe collection of .pdf and .doc files are a small sample of the written literature on this subject, all of which is available on the web.  All 5 of the videos can be found on Google or Youtube.\n\nCheck out the following web sites for more information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.toxicteeth.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.toxicteeth.org&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.mercurypoisoned.org\nhttp://www.iaomt.org\nhttp://www.mercurypolicy.org\nhttp://www.dentistrybiological.com\nhttp://www.snwcenter.com\nhttp://www.dentalvirtue.com\nhttp://www.halhuggins.com &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.acam.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.acam.org&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.mercola.com\nhttp://www.fluoridealert.org\n\nDo yourself a favor and research this subject for yourself online.  Do not get any more mercury dental fillings!  If you already have mercury fillings, find a responsible dentist who is trained to properly remove them as soon as you are able.  Do not trust medical snake oil salesmen!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2284746d003e7415e53c576922eedc67f73f9538","amp;dn":"Is+there+MERCURY+in+your+mouth+%28dental+amalgam+silver%29+FluxCapac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2284746d003e7415e53c576922eedc67f73f9538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,132,116,109,0,62,116,21,229,60,87,105,34,238,220,103,247,63,149,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
