This is a very important sermon for any SDA. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.godslastwarning.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.godslastwarning.com&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFall Away, Turn Away, Backslide, Lose Salvation by Dan Corner: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.EternalLifeBlog.Com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.EternalLifeBlog.Com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.EvangelicalOutreach.Org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.EvangelicalOutreach.Org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt is very clear from Jn 16:1 that it is not God's will that we go astray.

Learn the history of the Roman Catholic Church and their militia the Jesuit Order not taught in school textbooks.  Their counter reformation movement defeated the Protestant Reformation and its Sola Scriptora doctrine at the Council of Trent which opened the doors into the infiltration of modern Christian churches, run in secret by the RCC.\n\nNow, the Jesuit Order has manipulated the various Protestant and other Christian denominations into an unscriptural twisted dogma removing loving obediance of God's laws, chararcter and righteousness and supplanting them with teachings on Sola Grace.  Using the thesis/anti-thesis arguments to change the church mindset into abandoning Godly inspired scripture of the orginal early churches preached for centuries to an indoctrinated Roman Catholic Sunday Worship and commandments made by men.\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n                                           \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53274fb8f48922cb5f84ad29534f32e087c514b","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Apostasy+The+Great+Falling+Away+Vol+22+-+It+Has+Begun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53274fb8f48922cb5f84ad29534f32e087c514b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,50,116,251,143,72,146,44,181,248,74,210,149,52,243,46,8,124,81,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
