Field's Philosophical Writings\n\nHartry H. Field is Silver Professor of Philosophy at New York University and a leading contributor to philosophy of language, mind, and mathematics. He previously taught at Princeton University, the University of Southern California and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University under the direction of Hilary Putnam.\n\nHis first work was a commentary on Alfred Tarski's theory of truth, which he has worked on since 1972. His current view on this matter is in favor of a deflationary theory of truth. His most influential work produced in this period is probably &quot;Theory Change and the Indeterminacy of Reference&quot; (Journal of Philosophy, 70, 14: 462-481), in which he introduced the concept of partial denotation.\n\nIn the 1980s, Field started a project in the philosophy of mathematics discussing mathematical fictionalism, the doctrine that all mathematical statements are merely useful fictions, and shouldn't be taken to be literally true. More precisely, Field holds that the existence of sets may be denied, in opposition to Quine and Putnam.\n\nBooks Included:\n*Science Without Numbers, Blackwell, 1980\n*Realism, Mathematics, and Modality, Blackwell, 1989\n*Truth and the Absence of Fact, Oxford University Press 2001\n*Saving Truth From Paradox, Oxford University Press, 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8361773d1b26ba13a04e691dde2c4dad9418ee","amp;dn":"Hartry+H.+Field%27s+Philosophical+Writings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8361773d1b26ba13a04e691dde2c4dad9418ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,131,97,119,61,27,38,186,19,160,78,105,29,222,44,77,173,148,24,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
