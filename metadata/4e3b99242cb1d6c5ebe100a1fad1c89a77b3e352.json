That previous work assumed what Rawls calls a &quot;well-ordered society,&quot; one that is stable and relatively homogeneous in its basic moral beliefs and in which there is broad agreement about what constitutes the good life. Yet in modern democratic society a plurality of incompatible and irreconcilable doctrines -- religious, philosophical, and moral -- coexist within the framework of democratic institutions. Recognizing this as a permanent condition of democracy, Rawls asks how a stable and just society of free and equal citizens can live in concord when divided by reasonable but incompatible doctrines?\n\nThis edition includes the essay &quot;The Idea of Public Reason Revisited,&quot; which outlines Rawls' plans to revise Political Liberalism, which were cut short by his death.\n\nGenre: Non-fiction. Political philosophy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e3b99242cb1d6c5ebe100a1fad1c89a77b3e352","amp;dn":"Rawls%2C+John+-+Political+Liberalism+-+Expanded+Edition+%282005%29.epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e3b99242cb1d6c5ebe100a1fad1c89a77b3e352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,59,153,36,44,177,214,197,235,225,0,161,250,209,200,154,119,179,227,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
