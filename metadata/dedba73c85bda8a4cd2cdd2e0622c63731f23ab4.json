Lawrence novel. Set in an English mining town, the film focuses on Paul Morel (Dean Stockwell), the sensitive son of a roughhewn, alcoholic miner (Trevor Howard) and his gentle, repressed wife (Wendy Hiller). Intent on becoming an artist, Paul is not above depending upon the financial kindnesses of the young women of the town. Many of the girls carry a torch for him, but his strong bonds to his mother leave him emotionally sapped. Freddie Francis's evocative, grimy industrial-town cinematography won him an Academy Award. Despite censorial restrictions, this admirably captures the essence of the dour Lawrence original. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054326/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054326/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3316653/sons-and-lovers-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3316653/sons-and-lovers-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAwards:\nWon Oscar.
