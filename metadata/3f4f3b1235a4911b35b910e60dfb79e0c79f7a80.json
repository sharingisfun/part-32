From the &quot;explosive&quot; science and entrepreneurship of Alfred Nobel to a schoolboy&amp;#039;s first day in class, from the boldness and determination of Henry Ford to the shy but affectionate sentiment of a teen for another, &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; brings us on a journey in the multidimensional world of risk, a world where progress of humankind or personal accomplishment aren&amp;#039;t necessarily related to the scope or the nature of the endeavor.\n\n&quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; also teaches us that humanity can benefit from the unexpected and combined efforts of two very different risk takers whose minds meet across half a millennium and across the boundaries of the Old and New Worlds, as we witness the experiment of Leonardo Da Vinci&amp;#039;s notorious parachute by Adrian Nicholas, world&amp;#039;s most respected skydiver and inventor in his own right, monitored closely by Salford scientists who seek answers on critical and life pertaining matters. Incidentally, &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; doesn&amp;#039;t hesitate to explain scientific concepts in simple words. From the soaring and breathtaking cliffs of Norway to the calm and inspiring immensity of the Mojave Desert, from Thomas Edison&amp;#039;s laboratory to a simple American schoolyard, &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; is more than a thrilling visual experience, it&amp;#039;s an invitation to explore our inner selves and a statement that there is no such thing as having little courage.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: Divx6\nVideo Bitrate: 3300\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.75:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 448kbps 48kHz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRunTime Per Part: 38\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1000\nRipped by maga998\n\nwww mvgroup org avi ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f4f3b1235a4911b35b910e60dfb79e0c79f7a80","amp;dn":"IMAX+-+Adrenaline+Rush+%28Hi-Def%29+%5BDivX-AC3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f4f3b1235a4911b35b910e60dfb79e0c79f7a80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,79,59,18,53,164,145,27,53,185,16,230,13,251,121,224,199,159,122,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
