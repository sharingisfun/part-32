Have you noticed anything? NRA News contributor Colion Noir has: the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“gun controlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is being replaced by Ã¢â‚¬Å“gun safety.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s none too happy about it.\n\nColion Noir talks about how the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“gun safetyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is being used by gun-control advocates now. (Source: NRA News)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Unless they changed the gun safety rules, which are pretty much the Bible of the gun world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pretty sure theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still the same Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see how any of the proposed measures by anti-gunners will aid in the safety of gun use,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Noir says of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“gun safety placeboÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in his latest video after recapping the four foundational rules of gun safety.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Think about it, what changed?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he adds. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When they were calling it gun control, they wanted universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, high capacity magazine ban, round limitations, and every other useless measure that would do nothing to stop criminals. Now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re calling it gun safety like that somehow changed their intent, but nothing has changed. They still want the same things, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still going to get the same ineffective results.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nA quick search turns up articles from liberal-leaning sites like Salon and the Daily Beast using the term, and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer (D) invoking it this spring.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Their idea of gun safety is: Ã¢â‚¬ËœHere, give us all the guns and we will keep you safe because you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be trusted with an AR or a gun that has more than two rounds,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Noir says near the end. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We already said no to these options. Try something else.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For them to think that all they have to do is change the name of the same nonsense laws simply means they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t respect us, the same way they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t respect our Second Amendment right,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he concludes.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4660193c5fe0244bbbf6f40214f2a32d12fd91","amp;dn":"Armed+American+Radio+December+01+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4660193c5fe0244bbbf6f40214f2a32d12fd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,70,96,25,60,95,224,36,75,187,246,244,2,20,242,163,45,18,253,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
