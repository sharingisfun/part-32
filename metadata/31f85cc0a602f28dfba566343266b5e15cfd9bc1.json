The new releases were remastered and \nhad bonus tracks culled from single B-sides, studio outtakes \nand BBC broadcast sessions.\n\nThe Universal Music Group have bought the entire back \ncatalogue, and Stray are touring again with Bromham \n(guitar and vocals), Stuart Uren (bass guitar and vocals) \nand Karl Randall on drums. The latest album, Valhalla, \nproduced by Chris Tsangarides, was released on 4 October 2010 \non Angelair Records.
