In the last 10 years the North Atlantic has claimed the lives of 165 of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fishermen, making it AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadliest sea. Storms here form too fast to predict, and in the shallow fishing grounds off the east coast, breaking waves can sink a boat without a trace. Despite the dangers, Captain Eddie Welch, a survivor of three hurricanes and a boat sinking, heads out on the Westport. Scallop dredging in the Atlantic is dangerous even for a veteran sea captain, and leaving from the same port is rookie captain Tim Quinn who is out to prove he can handle the Atlantic in winter and bring in $350,000 worth of scallops in just 8 days of fishing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:509c34e7dda4b5897335e0fff4389dc858bbf41d","amp;dn":"Deadly+Seas+s01e03+The+North+Atlantic+HDTV-Killers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"509c34e7dda4b5897335e0fff4389dc858bbf41d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,156,52,231,221,164,181,137,115,53,224,255,244,56,157,200,88,187,244,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
