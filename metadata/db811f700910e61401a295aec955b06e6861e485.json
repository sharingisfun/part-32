She is a Christian and doesn&amp;#039;t want to have anything to do with a warrior. Though she grew up Roman, the adopted daughter of a retired general, Lygia is technically a hostage of Rome. Marcus gets Emperor Nero to give her to him for services rendered. Lygia resents this, but somehow falls in love with Marcus anyway. Meanwhile Nero&amp;#039;s atrocities get more outrageous. When he burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus goes off to save Lygia and her family. Nero captures them and all the Christians, and throws them to the lions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db811f700910e61401a295aec955b06e6861e485","amp;dn":"Quo+Vadis-1951-DVDRip-ElWoOd-Kusuku","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db811f700910e61401a295aec955b06e6861e485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,129,31,112,9,16,230,20,1,162,149,174,201,85,176,110,104,97,228,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
