The soundtrack contains ten original songs and seven score pieces, all but one of which were created, arranged and conducted by Academy Award winner composer Randy Newman. &quot;Never Knew I Needed&quot; was written and performed by Ne-Yo.

The score style varies around jazz, zydeco, blues and gospel.\n\nShaffer Chimere Smith (born October 18, 1979), better known by his stage name Ne-Yo, is an American pop and R&amp;B singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“songwriter, record producer, actor, and occasional rapper. Since his debut, Ne-Yo has had five top ten songs on the Billboard Hot 100 as a lead artist and two number-one albums on the Billboard 200. Ne-Yo has also amassed a catalog of chart-topping songs that he has written for other artists.\n\nNe-Yo broke into the recording industry as a songwriter, penning the hit &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; for singer Mario. The single's successful release in the United States prompted an informal meeting between Ne-Yo and Def Jam's label head, and signing a recording contract.\n\nIn 2006, he released his debut album, In My Own Words, which contained the US number one hit &quot;So Sick&quot;. Then in 2007, he released his sophomore album, Because of You which contained the US top 3 hit, &quot;Because of You&quot;.
