Two of the AlliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most important plans for winning World War II are at grave riskÃ¢â‚¬â€Operation OverlordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invasion of France, and the Manhattan ProjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s race to build the atomic bomb. A furious FDR turns to OSS spy chief Wild Bill DonovanÃ¢â‚¬â€and Donovan turns to his top agent, Dick Canidy, and his team. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve certainly got their work cut out for them.\n\nIn the weeks to come, they must fight not only the enemy in the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â€including figuring out how to sabotage GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Ã¢â‚¬Å“aerial torpedoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rocketsÃ¢â‚¬â€but the enemy within: Someone is feeding Manhattan Project secrets to the Soviets. Moles are bad enough. But if the Soviets build their own atomic bomb . . . who knows where that might lead?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02751cf2f82e204cfd172e8f09d9d0967276a196","amp;dn":"WEB+Griffin+-+The+Spymasters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02751cf2f82e204cfd172e8f09d9d0967276a196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,117,28,242,248,46,32,76,253,23,46,143,9,217,208,150,114,118,161,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
