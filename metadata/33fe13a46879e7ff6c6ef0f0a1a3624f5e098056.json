Sir Noi Crezant, the Lizard Knight, has been sent to gain the aid of the great warrior Amamiya Yuuhi in hopes of finding the Princess Samidare and protecting the planet from the incredible 'Biscuit Hammer' poised to crack the Earth in two. Unfortunately Yuuhi wants no part of it, and the Princess doesn't prove to be the shining 'hero of justice' role model that Noi had hoped for&quot;.\n\nThis amazing manga is one of the best stories i've ever read. I cry every time and laught out loud every time, too. This is the manga i love the most, even more than Shaman King, FullMetal Alchemist and Soul Eater. The psychological evolution of each characters is what make this story so incredible, more than the battles or anything else.\n\nWell, I didn't made the translation, the scans or anything. I just put everything together. Some are in rar, some in zip and some in cbr. Chapters 1- 24 are from SnoopyCool, 25-29 from DFCG and 30-65 is from Otakami (I don't know/ remeber who made the SP aka chapter 64,5).\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33fe13a46879e7ff6c6ef0f0a1a3624f5e098056","amp;dn":"Hoshi+no+Samidare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33fe13a46879e7ff6c6ef0f0a1a3624f5e098056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,254,19,164,104,121,231,255,108,110,240,240,161,163,98,79,94,9,128,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
