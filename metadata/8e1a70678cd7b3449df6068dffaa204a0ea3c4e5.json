Love, hate, comfort, boredom, excitement; the album expresses every-day human emotions blended with the unusual experience of living in Palestine during that period of time.\n\nMir'ah is composed and performed by Tamer Abu Ghazaleh in cooperation with a number of Palestinian and Egyptian performers. Artistic production by Al-Urmawi Center for Mashreq Music. \n\n\nTrackList:\n\n1 - 7ob\t\n2 - Look\t\t\n3 - Takhabbot\t\n4 - Al Shibak\t\n5 - Mir'ah\t\n6 - Dawameh\t\n7 - Hawwel Ya Ghannam\t\n8 - Sokoot\n\n\nDuration : 30:00 | Bitarte : 320 kBit/s | Year :2008| Front &amp; Back covers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1a70678cd7b3449df6068dffaa204a0ea3c4e5","amp;dn":"Tamer+Abu+Ghazaleh+-+2008+-+Mir%27ah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1a70678cd7b3449df6068dffaa204a0ea3c4e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,26,112,103,140,215,179,68,157,246,6,141,255,170,32,74,14,163,196,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
