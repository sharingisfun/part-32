Two sides of Hopkins are featured here with Billy Bizer, Spider Kilpatrick and Buster Pickens ironically accompanying on the Walkin' This Road By Myself cuts and Hopkins and his guitar doing the business on the Blues In The Bottle' sides. There are more of Hopkins eccentric lyrics on 'Happy Blues For John Glenn', written directly after the first American space flight and 'The Devil Jumped The Black Man'. A bumper package of some the finest examples of Lightnin' Hopkins' Texas blues.\n\nTrack list:\n\nBlues In My Bottle (1961)\n01. Buddy BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blues\n02. Wine Spodee-O-Dee\n03.
