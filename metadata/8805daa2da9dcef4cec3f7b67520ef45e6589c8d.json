Collected on this set are 20 of his hardest Dub tracks from the golden era of the genre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the mid to late seventies, with contributions from some of ReggaeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most celebrated talents including Dennis Brown, Horace Andy &amp; Augustus Pablo.\n\n01  King Tubby Meets The Rockers Uptown  [02:32]\n02  Invasion  [03:34]\n03  No Conscience (Dub)   [02:55]\n04  A Ruffer Version  [03:37]\n05  Buckshot Dub  [03:39]\n06  A Better Version  [03:26]\n07  Youth Man  [02:32]\n08  Jah Love Rockers Dub  [03:25]\n09  Stalag 17  [03:11]\n10  I Trim The Barber  [03:06]\n11  Three Times Three  [03:08]\n12  Dancing Roots  [02:35]\n13  The Big Rip Off  [03:07]\n14  A Harder Version  [03:28]\n15  Don't Think About Me (I'm Alright) Version  [03:04]\n16  New Style  [03:09]\n17  Channel One Feel It  [02:57]\n18  Dub Organiser  [03:18]\n19  Kingston Dub Town  [03:16]\n20  African World Wide  [03:26]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8805daa2da9dcef4cec3f7b67520ef45e6589c8d","amp;dn":"King+Tubby+-+The+Dubmaster+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8805daa2da9dcef4cec3f7b67520ef45e6589c8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,5,218,162,218,157,206,244,206,195,247,182,117,32,239,69,230,88,156,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
