I decided to go up to the source of them all: &quot;The 10th victim&quot;... one of the very few (luckily) italian sci-fi movies. It&amp;#039;s an uncanny, goofy, trashy, pathetically funny thing, that a superficial person like me deems worth watching to the end just because of the ravishing Ursula Andress... [howl]\n\nPleasant surprise: Mina sings the end credits song, the Spiral Waltz. I added it separately since it gives you an idea of what you&amp;#039;re gonna download: great singer - silly song, great cast - silly movie ...\n\n&quot;With subliminal influences on everything from &quot;Austin Powers&quot; (1997) to &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999) to Daredevil&amp;#039;s assassin girlfriend Elektra, &quot;The 10th Victim&quot; stands as one of the least known yet insider-influential classics of the SF cinema.&quot; ?
