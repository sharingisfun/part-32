Why does he watch as his goldfish washes down the drain? Why does he blow up balloons then release them out the window for no one to see? And for whom does he take out his clarinet to play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Quartet for the End of TimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢?.\n\nShot in 16mm, while Alfonso CuarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n was a film student, Cuarteto Para El Fin Del Tiempo is a meditation on isolation and a young manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s withdrawal from the outside world. Using very few words, CuarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n relies on the power of the image to narrate the film, for which there was no written script:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“It was an emotion rather than an idea that drove the process, it was about improvising and trying different things every day, trying to blend the character and the location with this emotion.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nNow, despite having achieved international recognition for his widely acclaimed features Y Tu MamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ TambiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n, Harry Potter and Children of Men, CuarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n still likes to submit his work to a second critical eye.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Even now I have great people guiding me through the filmmaking process. Even now I cannot complete a film without people like Guillermo del Toro or Alejandro Gonzalez IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±arritu putting their touch on my work.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard01-13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard01-13.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard02-13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard02-13.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard03-13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i783.photobucket.com/albums/yy116/muffy_kitteh/Clipboard03-13.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~ Cuarteto para el fin del tiempo.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................338,216,960                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................23:47.415                \n\nFrame Count:....................................34224             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................624                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.300                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1758                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.245&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................128                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2     \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
