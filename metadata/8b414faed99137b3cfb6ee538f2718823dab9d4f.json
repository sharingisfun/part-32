His nights are tormented by a recurring nightmare depicting a mysterious tragedy set in the past, which ends with his death; in addition to this, his newest novel with a voodoo theme is not proceeding as he would like.\n\nHis situation changes radically when he follows the track of a series of brutal murders taking place in the city - murders which seem to be linked to the ancient New Orleans voodoo cult. Hoping to get some inspiration for his book, Gabriel starts investigating on his own and as the clues thicken, they seem to lead to Malia Gedde, an upper-class and inaccessible woman with whom Gabriel falls in love. But the clues also lead, surprisingly, to Gabriel himself. Is it coincidence or destiny?\n\nA shadow lies on his family history, and the sins of the fathers will fall on their descendants. To save his life and those of his dear ones, Gabriel will have to confront his fate, and make the most difficult choice of his life.\n\n\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\nGame awards &quot;back then&quot; and a little thought that PC Zone Magazine had :P\n\n Best of E3 award, Computer Game Review &amp;#039;93\nAdventure Game of the Year `94, Computer Gaming World\nAdventure Game of the year, Strategy Plus\n\n&quot;The game is addictive, highly playable, and downright creepy.
