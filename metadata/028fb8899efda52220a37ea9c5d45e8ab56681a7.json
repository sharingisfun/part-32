July 29, 1925) is perhaps the most important Greek music composer of the 20th century, and one of the most significant in the world.\n\nComposer, born in Khios, Greece. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, and in 1959 his ballet Antigone was produced at Covent Garden. On his return to Greece he became intensely critical of the musical and artistic establishment. When the right-wing government took power in 1967, he was imprisoned and his music banned, but he was released in 1970, after worldwide appeals.\nHis prolific musical output includes oratorios, ballets, song cycles, and music for film scores, the best known of which is Zorba the Greek (1964), Z (1969), and Serpico (1973).\n\n\n\n\n\n01.
