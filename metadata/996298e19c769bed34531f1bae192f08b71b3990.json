With the tools in the kit, and MAKE's Learn to Solder Skill Badge, you'll be able to practice your soldering while making a fun wearable badge that shows the world you just learned a new skill.\n\n\nBy Brian Jepson, Tyler Moskowite, Gregory Hayes\nPublished by Make in 2012\nEPUB, 30 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:996298e19c769bed34531f1bae192f08b71b3990","amp;dn":"+Solder%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"996298e19c769bed34531f1bae192f08b71b3990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,98,152,225,156,118,155,237,52,83,31,27,174,25,47,8,183,27,57,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
