The answer is that all of these are caused by toxins, the powerful biological poisons released by bacteria and some plants.\n\nIn Toxin, Alistair Lax reveals the panoply of ways in which bacterial toxins overcome the defenses of our cells. He explains how they work, how they are so successful in causing major diseases, the terrible human impact they have had, and how apparently &quot;new&quot; diseases arise from them. He also discusses how we can combat toxins, and how we can harness their actions for beneficial purposes. Enlivened by the very human story of the persistence, rivalries, and insights from which modern microbiology grew, Toxin is the first widely accessible account of this exciting and important topic.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 208 pages\n    * Publisher: Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (December 1, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0198605587\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0198605584","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30865990a3aff274be85d56a906f5221d11d439d","amp;dn":"Toxin+-+The+Cunning+of+Bacterial+Poisons%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30865990a3aff274be85d56a906f5221d11d439d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,134,89,144,163,175,242,116,190,133,213,106,144,111,82,33,209,29,67,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
