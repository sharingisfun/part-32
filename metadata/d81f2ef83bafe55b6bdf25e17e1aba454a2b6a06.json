No other band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ certainly of U2's duration, commercial success and creative achievement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ believes it needs rebirth more and so often. But even by the standards of transformation on 1987's The Joshua Tree and 1991's Achtung! Baby, Songs of Innocence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ U2's first studio album in five years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is a triumph of dynamic, focused renaissance: 11 tracks of straightforward rapture about the life-saving joys of music, drawing on U2's long palette of influences and investigations of post-punk rock, industrial electronics and contemporary dance music. &quot;You and I are rock &amp; roll,&quot; Bono shouts in &quot;Volcano,&quot; a song about imminent eruption, through a propulsive delirium of throaty, striding bass, alien-choral effects and the Edge's rusted-treble jolts of Gang of Four-vintage guitar. Bono also sings this, earlier in a darker, more challenging tone: &quot;Do you live here or is this a vacation?&quot; For U2, rock &amp; roll was always a life's work Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the work is never done.\n\nSongs of Innocence is aptly named, after William Blake's 1789 collection of poems about man's perpetually great age of discovery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ childhood. For the first time, after decades of looking abroad for inspiration Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to American frontier spirituality, Euro-dance-party irony and historic figures of protest such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bono, the Edge, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. have taken the long way 'round to metamorphosis: turning back and inward, for the first time on a whole record, to their lives and learning as boys on the way to uncertain manhood (and their band) in Dublin.\n\nBono's lyrics are striking in their specific, personal history. In &quot;Cedarwood Road,&quot; named after a street where he lived, the singer remembers the fear and unrequited anger that drove him to music and to be heard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and which won't go away. &quot;I'm still standing on that street/Still need an enemy,&quot; he admits against Clayton and Mullen's strident, brooding rhythm and the enraged stutter of the Edge's guitar. &quot;Raised by Wolves&quot; is a tension of metronome-like groove and real-life carnage (There's a man in a pool of misery . . . a red sea covers the ground) based on a series of car bombs that bloodied Dublin one night in the Seventies.\n\nBand Members:\n\n\n  - Bono Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, harmonica\n   \n  - The Edge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, keyboards, vocals\n   \n  - Adam Clayton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n   \n  - Larry Mullen, Jr. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion, vocals\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n \n  1.
