It is also the host of the nearest known exoplanet, an ultra-hot, Earth-like planet recently discovered.\n\nJust 4.4 light years away Alpha Centauri is also the most obvious target for humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first directed interstellar space probe. Such a mission could reveal the small-scale structure of a new planetary system and also represent the first step in what must surely be humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest future adventureÃ¢â‚¬â€exploration of the Milky Way Galaxy itself.\n\nFor all of its closeness, ÃŽÂ± Centauri continues to tantalize astronomers with many unresolved mysteries, such as how did it form, how many planets does it contain and where are they, and how might we view its extensive panorama directly?\n\nIn this book we move from the study of individual stars to the study of our Solar System and our nearby galactic neighborhood. On the way we will review the rapidly developing fields of exoplanet formation and detection.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Astronomers' Universe\nPDF: 319 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (December 14, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319093711\nISBN-13: 978-3319093710\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a3f9c6e59de5bec6727b4ce14e402d038b6aa6","amp;dn":"Alpha+Centauri%3A+Unveiling+the+Secrets+of+Our+Nearest+Stellar+Nei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a3f9c6e59de5bec6727b4ce14e402d038b6aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,163,249,198,229,157,229,190,198,114,123,76,225,78,64,45,3,139,106,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
