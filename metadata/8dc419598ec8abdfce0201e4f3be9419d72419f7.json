It recreated a kitchen garden of the Victorian era at Chilton Foliat. The presenter was the horticultural lecturer, Peter Thoday, the master gardener was Harry Dodson\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nThe series began in the largely derelict walled garden at Chilton on a freezing January morning and followed Harry and his assistant Alison as they recreated the working kitchen garden.\r\n\r\nThe work involved many repairs from replanting the Box (Buxus) edging and replacing the gravel walks to reglazing the cold frames and repairing the magnificent Victorian wood-framed, brick-based glass-houses. The team were determined to use plants that the Victorian head gardener would have had available, so there were many hours of scouring old and modern catalogues and many disappointments. However, the required plants were found eventually. The programme displayed the various tools and techniques of Victorian gardening, and this was where Harry came into his own. He had used many of both and therefore could produce many of the tools from various cobwebbed corners of the service buildings and demonstrate how they were used.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe series was successful and spawned three sequels:\r\nThe Victorian Kitchen, 1989\r\nThe Victorian Flower Garden, 1991\r\nThe Wartime Kitchen and Garden, 1993\r\n\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Victorian_Kitchen_Garden\r\n\r\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\r\n\r\nThe Victorian Kitchen Garden - S01 - (13x30 Mins)\r\n\r\nThe Wartime Kitchen And Garden - S01 - (8x25 Mins)\r\n\r\n===================== General =====================\r\nComplete name               : The Victorian Kitchen Garden.avi\r\nFormat                      : AVI\r\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\r\nFile size                   : 350 MB\r\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 52s\r\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\r\nTotal bitrate               : 1 694 Kbps\r\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\r\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\r\n\r\n===================== Video =====================\r\nId                          : 0\r\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\r\nFormat profile              : Advanced   \r\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\r\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\r\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\r\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\r\nCodec Id                    : XVID\r\nCodec                       : XviD\r\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 52s\r\nBitrate                     : 1 444 Kbps\r\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\r\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\r\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\r\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\r\nColorimetry                 : YUV\r\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\r\nScan type                   : Progressive\r\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.193\r\nStream size                 : 298 MB (85%)\r\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\r\n\r\n===================== Audio =====================\r\nId                          : 1\r\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\r\nFormat version              : Version 1\r\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\r\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\r\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\r\nCodec Id                    : 55\r\nCodec                       : MP3\r\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 52s\r\nBitrate mode                : Variable\r\nBitrate                     : 238 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\r\nStream size                 : 49.1 MB (14%)\r\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\r\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\r\nInterleave preload          : 137 ms\r\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 19.7 --abr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc419598ec8abdfce0201e4f3be9419d72419f7","amp;dn":"The+Wartime+And+Victorian+Kitchen+And+Garden+-+History+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc419598ec8abdfce0201e4f3be9419d72419f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,196,25,89,142,200,171,223,206,2,1,228,243,190,148,25,215,36,25,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
