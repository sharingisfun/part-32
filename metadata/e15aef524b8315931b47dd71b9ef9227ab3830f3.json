This time the story is set during the Spanish Inquisition. Here's the description from the DVD box:\n\n//Set in the splendor and terror of the Spanish Inquisition, Flame in the Wind is a gripping drama of heroic Christian faith. It tells the story of Carlos, an earnest young nobleman who becomes involved in the age-old struggle between truth and error. Carlos is faced with a choice: the church system offers safety, protection and respectability, the Scriptures offer Christ and salvation from sin -- and with these, torture and death. To all those who trust Christ, Flame in the Wind is a challenge to be willing to endure persecution for the sake of the truth, even if it means the sacrifice of their lives.//\n\nDirected by Katherine Stenholm. Written by Tim Rogers. Starring David Hewson, Bob Jones Jr, Bob Jones III, Richard Rupp, Edward Panosian. \n\nPlease keep seeding and please rate it on IMDb when you've watched it (it's currently got less than 5 votes).\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nFile Name .......................................: Flame in the Wind 1971 CG.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,311,344,640 bytes\nRuntime .........................................: 2:02:31\n\nVideo Info\nVideo Codec .....................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 528x400 (AR: 1.320)\nFPS .............................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1228 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..................................: 0.243 bpp\nCompatibillity...................................: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Info\nAudio Codec .....................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate .....................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams ............................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15aef524b8315931b47dd71b9ef9227ab3830f3","amp;dn":"Flame+in+the+Wind+%281971%29+%28christian+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15aef524b8315931b47dd71b9ef9227ab3830f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,90,239,82,75,131,21,147,27,71,221,113,185,239,146,39,171,56,48,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
