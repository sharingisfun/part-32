It's the greatest mystery of science. Now, biologists, physicists and philosophers are closing in on finding the answer to the ultimate question.\n\nSpace seems like it goes on forever - but does it? Surprising new evidence suggests that not only is there a place where the universe ends - but there is something unimaginable lurking beyond it.\n\nTime is not what we think it is. New research questions the nature of time and challenges our most basic perceptions about reality.\n\nNew evidence forces us to consider a truly shocking possibility - is our reality an illusion?\n\nNew research is discovering that thoughts can fly across space and that we all may be part of a global consciousness. Scientifically, a sixth sense is entirely possible.\n\nThere could be more than one version of reality - and more than one you. As scientists unravel this possibility, a new astounding one emerges: these parallel worlds could determine the destiny of the entire universe.\n\nA revolution in science is underway that will transform life on Earth and ensure our survival as a species. If we can solve the equation of everything, it will present the keys to creation itself.\n\nPhysicists are designing warp drives, learning how to pry open wormholes, and finding cracks in the fabric of the cosmos to bring the final frontier within our grasp.\n\nDeath is a humbling reality - but what if life had no end? Cutting-edge science embarks on a bold mission to extend human life and may soon bring immortality within our grasp.\n\nAcross the galaxy lie exotic worlds made entirely of water or stewing with poisonous gas. What kinds of creatures thrive in these places? Would they resemble beings on Earth, or could life take on new and unexpected forms? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Morgan Freeman\n===========================\n\n\nProduced by: Geoffrey Sharp\n===========================\n\n\n\nExecutive Producer(s): Lori McCreary,Morgan Freeman,Tracy Mercer,Simon Andreae\n==============================================================================\n \n\n\n               \n\n\n\nTitle................: Through The Wormhole 2\nYear.................: 2011\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 00:42:13 (  ) 00:43:12 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: MPEG Layer-3 \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 624x352 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 1133 kbit/s ( ) 1160 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: External English\nFile Size:...........: 349 MB ( ) 350 MB [Episode 6  640 MB]\nFPS..................: 23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2011\nParts................: [10 Episodes]\n\n\n \n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1513168/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1513168/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1513168/episodes#year-2011&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1513168/episodes#year-2011&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n\n\n\n\n    Episodes:\n    =========\n\n 1) Is There Life After Death\n 2) Is There An Edge To The Universe\n 3) Does Time Really Exist \n 4) Are There More Than 3 Dimensions\n 5) Is There A Sixth Sense \n 6) Are There Parallel Universes\n 7) How Does The Universe Work\n 8) Can We Travel Faster Than Light\n 9) Can We Live Forever\n10) What Do Aliens Look Like\n\n\n\n\n[HDTV:]\n=======\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n \n \nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n=============\n\nAfter my account accidentally got deleted i had to restore it.However if you click \n\non DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT link it might not work for you.Use the magnet link(s)on\n\nmy older torrents instead,thank you.\n\n\n\n\n                                       *****\n\nIt's the complete season with the missing episode 6(Are There Parallel Universes?)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d10484b3e1ef628b64238cabe6cc203cb5d59a90","amp;dn":"Through+The+Wormhole+2-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d10484b3e1ef628b64238cabe6cc203cb5d59a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,4,132,179,225,239,98,139,100,35,140,171,230,204,32,60,181,213,154,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
