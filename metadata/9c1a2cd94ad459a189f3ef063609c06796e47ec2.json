Everything crashes down in the best theatrical tradition. \n\n1942 audiences must have got a thrill out of this, also they probably drew a connection to Hitler - the screenplay was adapted by Viennese exile Paul Merzbach. Nowadays it's probably suitable for devotees of old-school histrionics - those melodramatic shocks come fast and furious. What the hey, I got a lot of response to Green Dolphin Street.\n\nI am somewhat reminded of The Body Snatcher (1945), but its ghoulish touches and proper character development make that a better movie. Here, the monster simply exists, too remote to engage us in his character.
