In recent times, however, it has become a predominant ideology which has gained currency far beyond its original confines. Attempts to understand the origin and historical development of human culture, civilization and language, of the powers of human cognition, and even the origin of the moral and ethical values guiding and constraining everyday life in human societies are now cast in an evolutionary context. In ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvolutionary Theory and the Creation ControversyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the author examines evolutionary theory from a historical perspective, explaining underlying metaphysical backgrounds and fundamental philosophical questions such as the paradoxical problem of change, existence and creation. He introduces the scientists involved, their research results and theories, and discusses the evolution of evolutionary theory against the background of Creationism and Intelligent Design. \n\n204 pages \nPublisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (December 10, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b0d971584dec91c4f3ca43cdc93e129aef629ac","amp;dn":"Evolutionary+Theory+and+the+Creation+Controversy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b0d971584dec91c4f3ca43cdc93e129aef629ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,13,151,21,132,222,201,28,79,60,164,60,220,147,225,41,174,246,41,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
