He sends his two English speaking crewmen to procure a boat with enough power to pull them off. The 2 English speakers, along with 7 other Russian sailors, don&amp;#039;t exactly blend in and the town is convinced that they are being invaded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:308fa8738960d081a4154d2073679ecf7c119a7a","amp;dn":"The+Russians+Are+Coming+the+Russians+Are+Coming+%281966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"308fa8738960d081a4154d2073679ecf7c119a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,143,168,115,137,96,208,129,164,21,77,32,115,103,158,207,124,17,154,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
