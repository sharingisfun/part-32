Nikolaus Harnoncourt\n\n\n\nArmida is a beautiful enchantress in Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, who bewitched Rinaldo, one of the Crusaders, by her charms, as Circe did Ulysses, and who in turn, when the spell was broken, overpowered her by his love and persuaded her to become a Christian. The &quot;Armida Palace&quot; in which she enchanted Rinaldo has become a synonym for any merely visionary but enchanting palace of pleasure.\n\n\n\nArmida as an Opera:\n\nThe Armida story was set by several composers, including Lully, Handel, Gluck, Salieri, Jommelli, Josef MysliveÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ek, Sacchini, Haydn, Rossini and DvoÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k. The setting by DvoÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k was to be his last opera, beautifully orchestrated and reminiscent tonally to Rusalka in places, though, with a decidedly eastern feel.\n\n\nPlease be kind and seed long after downloading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c634088e326fc13e0832dd0ec09147e5da11fcc5","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+Armida++%28Bartoli+and+Harnoncourt%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c634088e326fc13e0832dd0ec09147e5da11fcc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,52,8,142,50,111,193,62,8,50,221,14,192,145,71,229,218,17,252,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
