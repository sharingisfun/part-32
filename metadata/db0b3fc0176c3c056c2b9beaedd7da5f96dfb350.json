Russian audio. Filmed at their St Petersburg Concert in Spring 2006.\n\nThe intro gives me shivers. Starting with the girls speaking in Russian, fading into the band playing instruments fast and loud, with fireworks going into a shaking image of the legendary &quot;t.A.T.u.&quot; logo with fans in the background, purely excited and ready for the show. \n\nAfter a while, the L I intro is playing and the girls are shined on by a spotlight in dark, black coats. They are the main attraction. Quickly you hear Lena's pure, haunting voice begin to sing. And Yulia picks up her lead and you know now the show has begun. \n\nAnd what do you expect at a t.A.T.u. show with over 100,000 fans, fire and explosions, video imagery and Lena and Yulia singing their hearts out? \n\nOne hell of a show that my subtitling couldn't do justice to. \n\nWhat makes the difference, aside from the amazing quality and new angles, is that in between every few songs are bonus materials and if you use your imagination, you can see a bit of what is going on behind the scenes and the effort that is put into making a show the best it can be. \n\nTRUTH is not only what t.A.T.u. show in their concerts (with audiences of 100,000 or 10), not only in their one-of-a-kind voices, not only in their love for each other and not only in their well-known videos. TRUTH is t.A.T.u. and this DVD shows it, as much as it can be shown. \n\nLong live t.A.T.u.\n\nTO ALL YOU WONDERFUL SEEDERS THANKS AND SEED THIS ONE PLEASE.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0b3fc0176c3c056c2b9beaedd7da5f96dfb350","amp;dn":"tATu+Truth+DVD+Inc+Menu+Eng+Subs+Covers.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0b3fc0176c3c056c2b9beaedd7da5f96dfb350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,11,63,192,23,108,60,5,108,43,155,234,237,215,218,95,150,223,179,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
