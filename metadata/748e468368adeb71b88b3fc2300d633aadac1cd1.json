The album was at #1 for eight weeks in early 1977 (non-consecutively), and included two tracks which became #1 hits as singles on the Billboard Hot 100: &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, on February 26, 1977, and &quot;Hotel California&quot; on May 7, 1977.\n\n         In 2001 the TV network VH1 named Hotel California #38 on 100 Greatest Albums of all time.
