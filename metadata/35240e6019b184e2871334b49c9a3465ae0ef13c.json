As a symptom of a new sociopolitical reality inundated with environmental catastrophes, sudden climatic changes, garbage-packed metropolises and para-economies of non-recyclable e-waste, environmental consciousness and the image of the earth re-emerges, after the 1960s, as an inevitable cultural armature for architects; now faced with the urgency to heal an ill-managed planet that is headed towards evolutionary bankruptcy. At present though, in a world that has suffered severe loss of resources, the new wave of ecological architecture is not solely directed to the ethics of the world's salvation, yet rather upraises as a psycho-spatial or mental position, fuelling a reality of change, motion and action. Coined as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EcoRedux', this position differs from utopia in that it does not explicitly seek to be right; it recognises pollution and waste as generative potentials for design. In this sense, projects that may appear at first sight as science-fictional are not part of a foreign sphere, unassociated with the real, but an extrusion of our own realms and operations.\n- Contributors include: Matthias Hollwich and Marc Kushner (HWKN), Fabiola Lopez-Duran and Nikki Moore, Anthony Vidler and Mark Wigley.\n- Featured architects: Anna Pla Catala, Jonathan Enns, Eva Franch-Gilabert. Mitchell Joachim (Terreform One), Francois Roche (R&amp;Sie(n)), Rafi Segal, Alexandros Tsamis and Eric Vergne.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35240e6019b184e2871334b49c9a3465ae0ef13c","amp;dn":"EcoRedux+-+Design+Remedies+for+an+Ailing+Planet+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35240e6019b184e2871334b49c9a3465ae0ef13c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,36,14,96,25,177,132,226,135,19,52,180,156,154,52,101,174,14,241,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
