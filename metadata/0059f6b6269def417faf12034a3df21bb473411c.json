Generations of readers have found it the ideal introduction to mathematics, offering accessible explanations of how theory arises from real-life applications.\n\n &quot;The main object of this book is to dispel the fear of mathematics,&quot; declares author W. W. Sawyer, adding that &quot;Many people regard mathematicians as a race apart, possessed of almost supernatural powers. While this is very flattering for successful mathematicians, it is very bad for those who, for one reason or another, are attempting to learn the subject.&quot;\n\nNow retired, Sawyer won international renown for his innovative teaching methods, which he used at colleges in England and Scotland as well as Africa, New Zealand, and North America. His insights into the pleasures and practicalities of mathematics will appeal to readers of all backgrounds.\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0059f6b6269def417faf12034a3df21bb473411c","amp;dn":"W.+W.+Sawyer+-+Mathematician%27s+Delight+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0059f6b6269def417faf12034a3df21bb473411c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,89,246,182,38,157,239,65,127,175,18,3,74,61,242,27,180,115,65,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
