Though it may be missing a fan favorite or two -- and that could mean something concise and catchy or meandering jams like &quot;T.N.U.C.&quot; -- this does have the overwhelming majority of their best songs, including not just hits like &quot;We&amp;#039;re an American Band&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful,&quot; but also album tracks. Some longtime fans, like Homer Simpson, may find favorites missing, but this remains a nearly ideal summary. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01.
