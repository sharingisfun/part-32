Starting at the Selig Polyscope Company he eventually moved to Keystone Studios where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd. He mentored Charlie Chaplin and discovered Buster Keaton and Bob Hope. He was one of the most popular stars of the 1910s, and soon became one of the highest paid, signing a contract to make $1 million a year in 1918.\n\nIn 1921 Arbuckle threw a party during Labor Day weekend. Bit player Virginia Rappe became ill at the party and died days later. Soon Arbuckle was accused of raping and accidentally killing Rappe, enduring three widely publicized manslaughter trials. His films were banned, his career was ruined, and he was publicly ostracized. Though he was acquitted by a jury and received a written apology, the trial's scandal has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. Though the ban on his films was eventually lifted, Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. In 1932 he began a successful comeback, which he briefly enjoyed before his death in 1933.\n\nKeystone Studios was an early movie studio founded in Edendale, California in 1912 as the Keystone Pictures Studio by Mack Sennett with backing from Adam Kessel and Charles O. Bauman, owners of the New York Motion Picture Company. The company filmed in and around Glendale and Silver Lake for several years, and was owned by the Mutual Film Corporation between 1912 and 1915.[1]\n\nThe studio is perhaps best remembered for the era under Mack Sennett when he created the slapstick antics of the Keystone Kops and for the &quot;Sennett Bathing Beauties.&quot; Charlie Chaplin got his start at Keystone when Sennett hired him fresh from his vaudeville career to make silent films. Charlie Chaplin at Keystone Studios is a 1993 compilation of some of the most notable films Chaplin made at Keystone, documenting his transition from vaudeville player to true comic film actor to director. In 1915 Keystone Studios became an autonomous production unit of the Triangle Film Corporation with D. W. Griffith and Thomas Ince. In 1917 Sennett gave up the Keystone trademark and organized his own company.\nThe &quot;Sennett Bathing Beauties&quot;\n\nMany other important actors also began their careers at Keystone, including Harold Lloyd, Gloria Swanson, Louise Fazenda, Raymond Griffith, Ford Sterling, Fatty Arbuckle, Marie Dressler, Mabel Normand, Ben Turpin, Harry Langdon and Chester Conklin.\n\nSennett, by then a celebrity, departed the studio in 1917 to produce his own independent films (eventually distributed through Paramount). The business of Keystone Studios decreased after his departure, and was finally dissolved after bankruptcy in 1935.\n\nMuch of the lighting &amp; studio equipment from Keystone was bought by Reymond King - who started the &quot;Award Cinema Equipment&quot; company in Venice, California in November, 1935.\n\nThe name &quot;Keystone Studios&quot; was used later as a production label for Cineville and was named as the fictional studio in the Cineville production &quot;Swimming With Sharks&quot; starring Kevin Spacey. A new legal corporate entity named Keystone Studios began again during 2005. The two owners are Carl Colpaert and Lee Caplin. Keystone obtained its new trademark in 2006.\n\nFile Confirmation:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : C:Documents and SettingsOwnerDesktopconvRoscoe [Fatty] Arbuckle[big_dad_e]Fatty Joins the Force (1913).mpg\nFormat                           : MPEG-PS\nFile size                        : 211 MiB\nDuration                         : 13mn 31s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 185 Kbps\nWriting library                  : Created by Nero\n\nVideo\nID                               : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Video\nFormat version                   : Version 2\nFormat profile                   : Main@Main\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nDuration                         : 13mn 31s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1 874 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 3 840 Kbps\nWidth                            : 496 pixels\nHeight                           : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nScan order                       : Bottom Field First\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.328\nStream size                      : 181 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : Created by Nero\n\nAudio\nID                               : 192 (0xC0)\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 2\nDuration                         : 13mn 31s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nVideo delay                      : -34ms\nStream size                      : 21.7 MiB (10%)\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.44\nDatabase version: 3668\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n1/31/2010 8:42:30 PM\nmbam-log-2010-01-31 (20-42-30).txt\n\nScan type: Quick Scan\nObjects scanned: 1\nTime elapsed: 15 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your \n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&lt;/a&gt;  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n\nALWAYS SEED! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000779/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000779/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f22a46c41fd5f2a4f7ee36a8f79d094f771f76c","amp;dn":"Roscoe+%5C%22Fatty%5C%22+Arbuckle+%28Six+Silent+Shorts%29+%5Bbig_dad_e%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f22a46c41fd5f2a4f7ee36a8f79d094f771f76c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,34,164,108,65,253,95,42,79,126,227,106,143,121,208,148,247,113,247,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
