For this work, he was awarded the State Music Prize for the Cinema.\r\n\r\nIn HONEYMOON, the listener can discern the extraordinary blending of wind instruments with the sensitive musicalness that the composer was so skilful in extracting from his musicians; whilst in FREE DIVING, Kypourgos focuses his attention mainly on the stringed instruments of the splendid Patras Soloists.
