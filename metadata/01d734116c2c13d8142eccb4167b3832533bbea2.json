The digital economy is built on it. Companies are tracking and analyzing every move we make, and they make billions mining and selling our information.\n\nAs citizens and consumers, we are the victims in an enormous race to build identity banks containing every little detail of our lives. Ã¢â‚¬Å“FreeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the default on the web, but you are paying with your data. Most often you neither notice the raw deal youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting, nor do you have a choice.\n\nThis book shines a spotlight on the many ways we are being duped and sold every day, and what the consequences are. From the workplace to the gym, from our relationships to our children at school all the way to the risks and dangers to political activism and free speech.\n\nFake It! explains what happens with your data, what it can cost you now and in years to come. And it lays out how you can protect yourself with a variety of easy-to-use tools. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never too late to fake it and take back your digital life.\n\nSteffan Heuer is a journalist covering technology in San Francisco. Pernille Tranberg is a journalist, advisor and speaker in Copenhagen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01d734116c2c13d8142eccb4167b3832533bbea2","amp;dn":"Fake+It%21+Your+Guide+to+Digital+Self-Defense+-+Tranberg%2C+Pernille","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01d734116c2c13d8142eccb4167b3832533bbea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,215,52,17,108,44,19,216,20,46,204,180,22,123,56,50,83,59,190,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
