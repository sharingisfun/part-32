Includes Navy, Army, and Air Force pictures. I tried to get a good variety of equipment and locations. None of the photos are graphic in nature. I gathered them from the internet over the course of several months. This group of photos was my desktop slideshow for several months, and I enjoyed them enough that I wanted to share them. \n\nPreview\n[link]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Color_Photographed_B-17E_in_Flight.jpg[/link]\n[link]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-299-1805-12,_Nordfrankreich,_Panzer_VI_%28Tiger_I%29.jpg[/link]\n[link]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M4-Sherman_tank-European_theatre.jpg[/link]\n\n\nLook for my Modern Russian Military Photos Torrent coming soon!\n\n\n--ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9801b08d4963de64f290f8bc65956e331467d3d4","amp;dn":"World+War+2+Photos+-+330+-+Great+for+Windows+background+slidshow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9801b08d4963de64f290f8bc65956e331467d3d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,1,176,141,73,99,222,100,242,144,248,188,101,149,110,51,20,103,211,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
