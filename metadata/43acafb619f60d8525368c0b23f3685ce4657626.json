It displayed his facility with the blues, speed, gospel influence, and interpretive abilities on such songs as John Lewis' &quot;Django&quot; and Clifford Brown's &quot;Daahoud.&quot; It also contained Bryant's funky originals &quot;Splittin&quot; and &quot;Blues Changes,&quot; and was punctuated by Ike Isaacs' careful bass work and Specs Wright's loose, in the groove drumming. This set has recently been reissued by Fantasy, and the remastering provides a fine sonic framework for Bryant's heady, unpredictable, and often exciting playing. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Golden Earrings\n02 - Angel Eyes\n03 - Blues Changes\n04 - Splittin'\n05 - Django\n06 - The Thrill Is Gone\n07 - Daahoud\n08 - Sonar\n\nEnjoy and share!
