Surrounded by lovers, legends, hustlers, preachers, and a wolfpack of kids, the unstable performer avoids the recording studio and is driven to spend time in his own form of self-discovery. Shown in fragments, his journey drags him from love and happiness right to the edge of another dimension. Featuring an explosive performance and score from Willis Earl Beal, MEMPHIS is a film steeped in folklore, music, surrealism, and the abstract search for glory.\n\nDirector: Tim Sutton\n\nWriters: Tim Sutton\n\nActors: Willis Earl Beal\n\nGenre: Drama, Musical\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 19 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:573c1710e06bdb1d3cd34d8384c87f9883d767a7","amp;dn":"Memphis.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"573c1710e06bdb1d3cd34d8384c87f9883d767a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,60,23,16,224,107,219,29,60,211,77,131,132,200,127,152,131,215,103,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
