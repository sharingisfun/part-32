Mores the pity. Henry Hathaways third entry in 20th CenturyFoxs series of postWWII thrillers is just about the best of the bunch. These films incorporated the semidocumentary techniques and wondrously persuasive on-location shooting Hollywood learned from Italian neorealism and the wartime filming of some of its own best directors. Kiss of Death is more fictional than documentary in thrust, with a solid script by ace screenwriters Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer. But that only makes its imaginative, atmospheric use of real places and spacese.g., a superb opening robbery sequence in a New York skyscraperthe more remarkable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dffc5a38e403a11f9fde95de7ab17d096383b50","amp;dn":"Kiss+of+Death+%281947%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dffc5a38e403a11f9fde95de7ab17d096383b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,255,197,163,142,64,58,17,249,253,233,93,231,171,23,208,150,56,59,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
