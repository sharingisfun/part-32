In 2009, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, co-written by Old Man River, won the 'Blues &amp; Roots Work of the Year' category at the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Awards.\n\n\n\n\n\nOhad Rein was born in Sydney, Australia. He moved to Europe with his family at a very early age before moving to Israel in his formative years. Spending many years abroad he finally returned to Sydney. He collaborated with Sydney band Gelbison, touring with the band and co-writing some of the tracks which appear on his debut album Good Morning. This led to the side project Nations by the river, which combined Gelbison with Luke Steele from Sleepy Jackson.\n\n\nThe single &quot;Sunshine&quot; (could have been a Beatles song) became the station's most played song in the summer of '06 and was used as a theme for Channel 7's Sunrise. The single &quot;La&quot; reached #83 on the German singles chart, topped the Japanese Radio Airplay chart and was #6 on Italy's airplay chart. &quot;La&quot;, &quot;Trousers&quot; and &quot;Sunshine&quot; all received significant airplay on Triple J.\n\nThe single &quot;La&quot; was featured in the 'New York Lotto Powerball - Mega Millions' commercial.\n\n\nMembers:\n\n* Ohad Rein (Vocals, Guitar)\n* Liam Flanagan (Bass Guitar)\n* Danny Heifetz (Drums)\n* Rosie Henshaw (Backing Vocals, Sitar)\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re On My Mind\n02 - Shanti Aaye (Luke Steele Remix)\n03 - Sailing\n04 - Be the Change\n05 - YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re On My Mind (Katalyst Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_River_%28musician%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_River_%28musician%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.trustomr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.trustomr.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf73146542a439876f4b441c7c712cfc8fc9a25","amp;dn":"Old+Man+River+-+You%5C%27re+On+My+Mind+%28EP%29%282010%29%28Indi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf73146542a439876f4b441c7c712cfc8fc9a25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,247,49,70,84,42,67,152,118,244,180,65,199,199,18,207,200,252,154,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
