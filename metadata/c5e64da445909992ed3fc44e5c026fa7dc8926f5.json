Doctor Who Theme - Album Version\n\n\nDoctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack is a soundtrack album released on 4 December 2006, containing incidental music composed by Murray Gold and used in the 2005 and 2006 series of Doctor Who.\nThe release included a fourteen-page booklet containing an introduction to the album by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Executive Producer Julie Gardner, written on 8 November 2006; and four pages of comments on the contents of the album, written by Murray Gold in November 2006. The booklet also featured many publicity pictures, including a Cyberman, a Dalek ship, Matron Casp and the New Earth Hospital, the Doctor and Rose, and a Slitheen. The last page has a picture of Dalek Sec from &quot;Doomsday&quot;.\nIt was originally released as a special limited edition, which featured a cardboard slipcase containing the jewel CD case, as well as a small badge featuring the Doctor and Rose, as seen on the cover artwork. In 2008 a new cover was released for this album, removing Rose and including a different picture of the Doctor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5e64da445909992ed3fc44e5c026fa7dc8926f5","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who%3A+Original+Television+Soundtrack+-+Murray+Gold.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5e64da445909992ed3fc44e5c026fa7dc8926f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,230,77,164,69,144,153,146,237,63,196,78,92,2,111,167,220,137,38,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
