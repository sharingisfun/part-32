It's hard to put it in terms of &quot;it's about...&quot;, since the sequence of images is not based in any form of traditional narrative. In fact, it's the very opposite of it, its essence sprouting from the need of subversion, a need directly connected to the social/historical/political/artistic context of the 60's and 70's: to show things in a different way leads the viewer to see differently, therefore to think differently. A experimental cut, poetic even, given the metaphorical quality of the images. The frontiers of film language fades and encounters those of other art forms, not to weaken the film unity nor its message, but to strengthen them both.\r\n\r\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Le vent d'est.1970.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 867 Kbps\r\nLength            : 4.46 GiB for 1h 32mn 57s 440ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 215 Kbps\r\nAspect            : 960 x 720 (1.333) at 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : fr\r\n\r\nText #0           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #1           : UTF-8\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #2           : UTF-8\r\nLanguage          : es\r\n\r\nText #3           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : ja\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065173/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: French\r\nSubtitles: English Spanish Japanese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661d584df0b68fd6445f63284633c3bdeee19c7c","amp;dn":"Le+vent+d%27est.1970.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661d584df0b68fd6445f63284633c3bdeee19c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,29,88,77,240,182,143,214,68,95,99,40,70,51,195,189,238,225,156,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
