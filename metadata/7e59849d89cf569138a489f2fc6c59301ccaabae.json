In the new commercial climate many glam metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up.  Many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, but  they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands\\' commercial viability during the decade. Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith\n\n               LENNY KRAVITZ  -  MR.

SOUL MUSIC \n\n         As disco and funk were dominating the charts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from soft rock and adult contemporary. Many funk bands, such as Con Funk Shun, Cameo, and Lakeside would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson, Atlantic Starr, and Larry Graham.  After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R&amp;B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style.\n\n           BARRY WHITE  -  When Will I See You Again  (1990)\n           BARRY WHITE  -  Put Me In Your Mix  (1991)\n           BARRY WHITE  -  Practice What You Preach  (1994)\n           PERCY SLEDGE   -  WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN  (1994)\n           BARRY WHITE  -  Come On   (1995 )\n                      \n\n\n11.15.   CONTEMPORARY R&amp;B (1990 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1999)\n\n         Contemporary R&amp;B (also known as simply R&amp;B) is a music genre that combines elements of hip hop, soul, R&amp;B and funk.

Original Euro dance is a fusion of several styles of dance music, primarily house and rap with the Hi-NRG variant of disco music.,   especially Italo-Disco  Some examples of \\&quot;original\\&quot; Euro dance acts are Vengaboys, Alcazar, Infernal, Alexia, 2 Unlimited, Bad Boys Blue, Cappella, Captain Hollywood Project, Centory, Corona, Culture Beat, DJ Bobo, Dr. Alban, E-Type, Fun Factory, Ice MC, Imperio, Indra, La Bouche, 2 Brothers On The 4th Floor, Le Click, Maxx, Playahitty, Real McCoy, Whigfield, Darude and First Base.\n\n\n\n\n         Euro dance has served to popularize rap music in Europe. While rap had been made in Europe at least as far back as Falco\\'s Einzelhaft album (1982), the American variety only gained a more widespread acceptance when Technotronic landed their hit \\&quot;Pump Up the Jam\\&quot;, followed by Snap\\'s \\&quot;The Power\\&quot;. The combination of house music with rap vocals in general came to be referred to as Hip house or \\&quot;house rap\\&quot;.\n\n\n             TECHNOTRONIC -   PUMP UP THE JAM  (1989)\n             TECHNOTRONIC  - THIS BEAT IS TECHNOTRONIC  (1989)\n             TECHNOTRONIC  -  MOVE THIS   (1989)\n             SNAP  - THE POWER  (1990)\n             SNAP  - THE POWER  \\'96   (1996) -  (remix version)\n             SNAP  - COLOUR OF LOVE  (1992)\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e59849d89cf569138a489f2fc6c59301ccaabae","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+348","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e59849d89cf569138a489f2fc6c59301ccaabae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,89,132,157,137,207,86,145,56,164,137,242,252,108,89,48,28,202,171,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
