Their\nchief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery.\nAnd the aim of this organization is POWER. Power in its most\ndespotic exercise. Absolute power, universal power, power to control\nthe world by the volition of a single man . . .\nThe General of the Jesuits insists on being master, sovereign, over the\nsovereign. Wherever the Jesuits are admitted they will be masters, cost\nwhat it may . . . Every act, every crime, however atrocious, is a\nmeritorious work, if committed for the interest of the Society of the\nJesuits, or by the order of the general.ÃƒÂ¢??\n- Napoleon Bonaparte in his Memoirs\n\nÃƒÂ¢??We [the Popes] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty.ÃƒÂ¢??\n- Pope Leo XIII, 1894 Encyclical Letter, June 20, 1894\n\nÃƒÂ¢??I am the Pope; I am king over all; I am God on earth. When I speak,\nmy word is the word of God, and you are to remember this as long as\nyou live.ÃƒÂ¢??\n- Pope Pius XI, 1924 Speaking to Schoolchildren at the Vatican &quot;Alien Rome&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢??The Pope must admonish kings and punish them with death.ÃƒÂ¢?? {68}\n- Antonio Santarelli, 1626 Italian Jesuit &quot;Del Papa&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢??It is my opinion that if the liberties of this countryÃƒÂ¢??the United States of\nAmericaÃƒÂ¢??are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic\nJesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and\nreligious liberty. They have instigated most of the wars of Europe.ÃƒÂ¢?? {70}\n- General Lafayette, 1799 Aide to General Washington \n&quot;Romanism: A Menace to the Nation&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nEric Jon Phelps - First Amendment Radio on Biblical Truth in History and Prophecy\n\nMr Phelps gives a fascinating and passionate historical account of the sinister \n\nidentity of the Papacy and how this diabolical institution raped, pillaged and \n\nplundered the once mighty United States, dispicable and viperous deeds that continue \n\nto this very day.\n\nListen to this attention gripping series and support this great reseacher by buying \n\nhis monumental historical work: Vatican Assassins, currently running at its third and \n\nfinal edition:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vaticanassassins.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vaticanassassins.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://firstamendmentradio.com/archives.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://firstamendmentradio.com/archives.html&lt;/a&gt;\n \n----------------------------------------------------\n\nTech specs:\n\nEric_Jon_Phelps--April-15-2008--Papacy-1 - 58m24s\nEric_Jon_Phelps--April-16-2008--Papacy-2 - 58m24s\nEric_Jon_Phelps--April-17-2008--Papacy-3 - 58m24s\nEric_Jon_Phelps--April-18-2008--Papacy-4 - 58m24s\nEric_Jon_Phelps--April-21-2008--Papacy-5 - 58m24s\n\nTotal playtime: 292m = 4h52m\n\nMPEG-2 layer 3 (mp3)\n24kbit\n22050Hz Mono\n\n===============================================================================\nOur leaders lie, cheat, steal and kill with virtual impunity.
