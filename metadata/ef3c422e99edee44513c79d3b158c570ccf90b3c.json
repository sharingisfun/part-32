ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s during the stage of denial when Alex Hart meets Andrew Foster. He takes her one-step closer to acceptance: the stage when new, meaningful relationships are formed. The stage when the realization occurs that this is now the new state of normal.\n\nJust when Alex thinks she is on her way to healing, she enters the bargaining phase. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the phase where you wonder what you could have done differently. You wonder Ã¢â‚¬Å“what if?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Specifically, what if the ones you loved hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t left you?\n\nLeavingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦this is what makes heading off to war so difficult and frightening for Alex. She knows all too well what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to be the one on the losing end of life, which is why sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made it her personal mission in life to save as many lives as possible. The extreme high she gets from treating trauma victims turns into AlexÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own form of therapy, or so she thinks.\n\nWhen faced with her world being turned upside down, Alex may just find that her true therapy is in the one who has always saved her.\n\nGenre: Contemporary Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3c422e99edee44513c79d3b158c570ccf90b3c","amp;dn":"Skipping+Stones+-+J.B.+McGee.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3c422e99edee44513c79d3b158c570ccf90b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,60,66,46,153,237,238,68,81,60,121,211,177,88,197,112,204,249,11,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
