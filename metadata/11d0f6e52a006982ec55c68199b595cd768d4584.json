Unable to find work he reluctantly joined the police force, but in his letters home he led his parents to believe that he had become a parish priest. This was in order to keep their minds at ease, since they did not want him to get into such a dangerous profession like his father. When his widowed mother Mary moved into his New York flat, David was forced to maintain the deception in fear that the truth would cause her a heart attack.\n\nThus, when he leaves for work, &quot;Father David Solomon&quot; is dressed as a priest on his way to his chapel, but in the elevator he switches to casual clothes which he wears as Lieutenant David Solomon aka &quot;Soda&quot; of the NYPD. He switches back to his priest's uniform when returning to the flat.\n\n\n\nIn this part, a young nurse held on drugs charges dramatically escapes while being transferred. Soda dismisses her claims of innocence but soon finds that he has to take them seriously if only for the sake of his mother.\n\nThis is the first issue with a proofreader: many thanks Daniel!\nAlso thanks for Incubus and some suggestions for translations of French slang.\n\nWhen an official release is released, this torrent will probably be deleted.
