In 1954 the founder of Los Angeles-based Specialty Records, Art Rupe, bought 35 Hooker tunes, several of which had been cut in Detroit four years earlier. Rupe issued one single to test the market: &quot;I'm Mad&quot; backed with &quot;Everybody's Blues.&quot; The record sales were disappointing and the tapes remained in the can until surfacing in 1970. Like so many John Lee Hooker compositions, over the years these songs were re-recorded, sometimes with different titles, and then slapped on one of the many albums released by a mixed bag of labels. However, these 14 tracks represent a composite of those raw early sides, featuring both solo Hooker (with his guitar and stompin' foot) and fronting a raucous juke joint combo. As an extra bonus, the Specialty Profiles series includes a sampler that showcases R&amp;B gems by Specialty acts of the era, including Little Richard, Sam Cooke, Larry Williams, Roy Milton, Lloyd Price, Percy Mayfield, Don &amp; Dewey, Joe Liggins, Jesse &amp; Marvin, and Guitar Slim.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f02631b0598611359c1946e7d4465e43c00e20","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+Specialty+Profiles+%282006%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f02631b0598611359c1946e7d4465e43c00e20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,240,38,49,176,89,134,17,53,156,25,70,231,212,70,94,67,192,14,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
