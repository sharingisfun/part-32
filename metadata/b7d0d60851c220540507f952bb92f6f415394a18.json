The style of the content is easy going but not flimsy. I would say that the format is somewhere between an audio book and an audio lecture. It's well written, concise and to the point but not overly tedious. And of course, it's not every day you get the chance to listen to someone like Charlton Heston lecturing about ancient Greek philosophy ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d0d60851c220540507f952bb92f6f415394a18","amp;dn":"Knowledge+Products+-+Philosophy+and+Science+Course+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d0d60851c220540507f952bb92f6f415394a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,208,214,8,81,194,32,84,5,7,249,82,187,146,246,244,21,57,74,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
