My Dad bought this album in 1979 and I was listening mainly to Queen,Santana and Rick Wakeman in those days and I remember hearing the first song on the album, Egyptian Danza and was astounded, this was amazing playing, the beauty of his tone, the incredible technique and all those great melodies and rhythms, I have been an Al Di Meola's fan ever since. After I heard that album I turned my attention to his two previous albums The Land of the Midnigt Sun and Elegant Gypsy (which I think is his ultimate masterpiece and one of the great fusion classics of the 70's) and also to Return to Forever which introduced me to the excellent works of Chick Corea and then on to other great fusion masters like John Mclaughlin and Weather Report.\nThe thing I like so much about fusion is the freedom in this type of music, different players are fusing different things together so it is difficult to give a good description of what the fusion style is,it is very varied. (although in the mid 80's the form kind of stagnated and degenerated into fusac, which Meola thankfully stayed away from). On this CD, Al is fusing together Jazz,Latin,Rock,Flamengo and Egyptian music together in a beautiful blend.\nThanks Al, for introducing me to one of the great musicial forms ever.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
