She earned her certificate with good mention from the Cordon Bleu de Paris at Sabine de Mirbeck Ecole de Cuisine Francaise in England. Upon returning to Canada, Debbie established a catering business called Decadence Catering and Cakes in Victoria, BC. A few years later, she opened a corresponding restaurant, Decadence CafÃƒÂ© and Catering, which she ran successfully until 2000. Today, Debbie has changed her culinary focus from catering to educating others about food by writing cookbooks and teaching cooking classes. Debbie is also a talented artist, and her drawings can be found alongside her mouthwatering recipes in her two cookbooks, Go Nuts: Recipes that Really Shell Out and Cravings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:083aaf6eff80e56d82e7fdb32235577604d1d1d8","amp;dn":"Cravings+-+Comfort+Eats+and+Favourite+Treats+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"083aaf6eff80e56d82e7fdb32235577604d1d1d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,58,175,110,255,128,229,109,130,231,253,179,34,53,87,118,4,209,209,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
