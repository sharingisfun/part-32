So I encoded all the \n videos to DivX. Then I figured I would throw in the Reason ones also, so I \n re-encoded those too. Flash .MOV Videos were not converted but I did leave them\n inside the folder in case people wanted to view them on their PC. I had to \n shorten some file names because I found out the disc would not play in my home \n DVD/DivX player if it had any files with long  filenames. It took me 2 \n Lightscribe DVDs &amp; 3 CDR coasters to figure this out. I decided to release this \n repacked to share with others who  would like the  same. Please seed. Don&amp;#039;t \n just be a greedy leacher please. You  wouldn&amp;#039;t have  this if someone didn&amp;#039;t \n share it with you so you should do the same. :)\n\nCREDITS:\nCredit goes to all the original release groups. (Check filenames above) I did not \npull out the NFOs. If it doesn&amp;#039;t have an NFO it didn&amp;#039;t have one and that&amp;#039;s how I \ngot it. The only credit to me is listed below.\n\n *Repacked\n *Custom Disc Covers. JPEG &amp; Lightscribe Version (PSD &amp; PNG included)\n *Re-Encoded Video Files\n *Re-Organised Renamed files so they play in order on Home DVD/DivX Player\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Directions\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDVD / DivX Player: \nYou must have a DVD Player that plays DivX Videos. You can buy one inexpensively \nfor $30-70. You can get a really good one that plays DVD/DVDR/VCD/SVCD/JPEG/DivX \nfor $50 at Wallmart. Or of course you can play them on your PC using a player \nwith DivX Codec. \n\nISO USAGE &amp; BURNING INSTRUCTIONS:\nBurn using an ISO burning program such as Nero. Or unpack using ISOBuster, \nWinRAR, or Daemon Tools. (All included in the &quot;Covers and Extras&quot; folder)\n\nCOVER:\nJPG cover - just use a CD Cover App.\nLightscribe - Print using Nero Cover Designer with Lightscribe update installed\nor another Lightscribe compatible cover program.
