I&amp;#039;ve always found this movie a little sad, but it&amp;#039;s probably more realistic then most Disney movies of this era. Enjoy\n\nNOTE: One way to help with the audio hiss is to adjust the ffdshow audio decoder equalizer settings. Drop the &quot;16000&quot; setting on the far right to meet your liking, it helps quite a bit.\n\nWhen the owner of a Yorkshire coal-mine decides to mechanize to increase profits, the mine&amp;#039;s pit ponies are scheduled to be destroyed. So, three children plan to steal them to keep them safe. But when they&amp;#039;re caught, it&amp;#039;s up to the mine owners and the miners themselves to decide what&amp;#039;s right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f449a5c2ed2a14c80b64d8a2a10360c15f6240fe","amp;dn":"Disney+Movie+-+Escape+from+the+Dark+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f449a5c2ed2a14c80b64d8a2a10360c15f6240fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,73,165,194,237,42,20,200,11,100,216,162,161,3,96,193,95,98,64,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
