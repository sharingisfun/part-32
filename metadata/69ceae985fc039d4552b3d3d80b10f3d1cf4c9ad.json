Lookin' at you, Part 3!!\n\nBut now Fall has fallen and a young man's fancy turns to Eclipse Fill Part 4. Let's meet our contestants:\n\nCyber 7 1-7 and Cyber 7 Book Two 1-10 - B&amp;W manga from Shuho Itahashi.\n\nScorpio Rose 1-2 - Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers begin a story involving a &quot;Coyote&quot; supporting character. Key word here is 'begin'.\n\nLoose issues - Brian Bolland's Black Book, Contractors, The Weasel Patrol, Will Eisner Presents Mr. Mystic and Xenon #2.\n\n\nSo this wraps things up for now. With a smidgen of luck, I may be closing out another series before the weekend. PLEASE, if anyone has any of the books listed in the 'Eclipse Missing (updated).txt' included in this upload, contact me at the email address provided. Remember, incomplete series is one of the gravest dangers facing our society today!\n\nAs always, muchas gracias creative teams and scanners!
