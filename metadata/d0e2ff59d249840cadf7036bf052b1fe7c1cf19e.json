Informal certainly describes the contents of this CD, which focuses on some no-drums, no-bass duets that pianist Bill Evans and vibist Don Elliott performed in the latter's Connecticut studio in 1956 and 1957. \n\nThe performances are essentially a jam/rehearsal -- Evans and Elliott never meant for any of these recordings to be released commercially, and they remained in the can until Fantasy assembled Tenderly in 2001. Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't great -- listenable, but not great. \n\nThere is way too much tape hiss, and recordings from 1956 and 1957 have the sort of pre-high fidelity sound you would expect from 78-era recordings. Even so, Evans' hardcore fans will enjoy this CD because it's interesting to hear the pianist in such a loose and informal setting. Evans and Elliott don't sound very focused -- Tenderly is simply two colleagues getting together, rehearsing, jamming, and having a friendly musical dialogue. Well-known standards dominate the album, although Tenderly also contains an early performance of Evans' &quot;Funkallero&quot; (which the pianist didn't record commercially until the early '60s). Again, Tenderly is far from essential and isn't for those who have only a casual interest in Evans' pianism -- this CD is strictly for collectors.-\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.Tenderly \n02.I'll Take Romance \n03.Laura \n04.Blues # 1 \n05.I'll Know \n06.Like Someone In Love \n07.Love Letters \n08.Thou Swell \n09.Airegin \n10.Everything Happens To Me \n11.Blues # 2 \n12.Stella By Starlight \n13.Funkallero \n\n*Milestone Records Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ MCD 9317-2\n\nPersonnel: Bill Evans: piano, Don Elliot: Vibraphone [Vibes],percussion.\n\n\n\n\nBill Evans - The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961 (2005)[3CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8845646/Bill_Evans_-_The_Complete_Village_Vanguard_Recordings_1961_(2005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8845646/Bill_Evans_-_The_Complete_Village_Vanguard_Recordings_1961_(2005&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nBill Evans Trio &amp; Guests - Live In Nice 1978 [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8759239/Bill_Evans_Trio__amp__Guests_-_Live_In_Nice_1978__[2CD]__[EAC-FL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8759239/Bill_Evans_Trio__amp__Guests_-_Live_In_Nice_1978__[2CD]__[EAC-FL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0e2ff59d249840cadf7036bf052b1fe7c1cf19e","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+and+Don+Elliott+-+Tenderly+An+Informal+Session+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0e2ff59d249840cadf7036bf052b1fe7c1cf19e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,226,255,89,210,73,132,12,173,247,3,107,240,82,177,254,124,28,241,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
