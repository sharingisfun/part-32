T. Almasi has fused the intricate cat-and-mouse games of a John le CarrÃƒÂ© novel with the brash style of comic book superheroes to create a kick-ass alternate history that reimagines the Cold War as a clash of spies with biological, chemical, and technological enhancements.\n\nNineteen-year-old Alix Nico, a self-described Ã¢â‚¬Å“million-dollar murder machine,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a rising star in ExOps, a covert-action agency that aggressively shields the United States from its three great enemies: the Soviet Union, Greater Germany, and the Nationalist Republic of China. Rather than risk another all-out war, the four superpowers have poured their resources into creating superspies known as Levels.\n\nAlix is one of the hottest young American Levels. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no surprise: Her dad was AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top Level before he was captured and killed eight years ago. But when an impulsive decision explodesÃ¢â‚¬â€literallyÃ¢â‚¬â€in her face, Alix uncovers a conspiracy that pushes her to her limits and could upset the global balance of power forever.\n\n\n\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab3f6b16d028eead9a9391980757e1b93f44d1b","amp;dn":"Blades+of+Winter+by+G.+T.+Almasi+%28Shadowstorm+Book+1%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab3f6b16d028eead9a9391980757e1b93f44d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,179,246,177,109,2,142,234,217,169,57,25,128,117,126,27,147,244,77,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
