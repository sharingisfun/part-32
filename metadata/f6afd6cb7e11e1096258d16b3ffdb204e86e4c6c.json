Montgomery, &quot;The Powers That Be: Global Energy for the Twenty-first Century and Beyond&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 0226535002 | 2010 | PDF | 408 pages | 3 MB\n\nThirty years ago, our global energy landscape did not look remarkably different from what it does today. Three or four decades from now, it certainly will: dwindling oil reserves will clash with skyrocketing demand, as developing nations around the world lead their citizens into the modern energy economy, and all the while, the grave threat of catastrophic climate change looms ever larger. Energy worries are at an all-time highÃ¢â‚¬â€just how will we power our future?\n\n\n\nWith The Powers That Be, Scott L. Montgomery cuts through the hype, alarmism, and confusion to give us a straightforward, informed account of where we are now, and a map of where weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going. Starting with the inescapable fact of our current dependence on fossil fuelsÃ¢â‚¬â€which supply 80% of all our energy needs todayÃ¢â‚¬â€Montgomery clearly and carefully lays out the many alternative energy options available, ranging from the familiar, like water and solar, to such nascent but promising sources as hydrogen and geothermal power. What is crucial, Montgomery explains, is understanding that our future will depend not on some single, wondrous breakthrough; instead, we should focus on developing a more diverse, adaptable energy future, one that draws on a variety of sourcesÃ¢â‚¬â€and is thus less vulnerable to disruption or failure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6afd6cb7e11e1096258d16b3ffdb204e86e4c6c","amp;dn":"The+Powers+That+Be%3A+Global+Energy+for+the+Twenty-first+Century+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6afd6cb7e11e1096258d16b3ffdb204e86e4c6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,175,214,203,126,17,225,9,98,88,209,107,63,253,178,4,232,110,76,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
