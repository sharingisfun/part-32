This emotion-touching drama shows how one first century Rabbi (Yehudah, played by Nick Mancuso) becomes a follower of Yeshua of Nazareth (Jesus Christ). Yehudah attempts to share the Good News of Jesus with his people, beginning with his own relatives. Now, one year has passed since the crucifixion of the carpenter's son. Yehudah's greatest challenge and earnest desire is to help his loved ones understand that the long awaited Messiah, the Son of David, walked among them. Through the Passover feast spoken of by Moses, Yehudah reveals the meaning behind the meal while his relatives slowly awaken to the fact that God's chosen people crucified the very Messiah whose reign they have awaited so long.\n\nThe Messiah: Prophecy Fullfilled is an excellent tool for sharing with those who may grapple with who Jesus really was and is today.\n\nFor more details see the links,\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=296&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=296&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRuntime: 50 mins\nLanguage: English (No-Subtitles)\nYear: 2004\nMy Rating: 10/10\nQuality: 10/10\n\nI would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available.\nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic ins't it?\n\n2. Please seed the movies. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families.\n\nRemember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell.\n\nPS: If you need any specific Christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ec858288858d828f849e859f98858d82dedcdcd5ac958d848383c28f83c28582&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you!

For the novice as well as the sophisticate, this book is full of surprises. It includes subtle discoveries lying just &quot;beneath&quot; the text - hidden messages, encryptions, deliberate misspellings and other amendments to the text - that present implications beyond the immediate context, demonstrating a skillful design that has its origin from outside our space and time. Drawing upon over forty years of collecting, Chuck higlights in this book many of the precious nuggets that have become characteristic of his popular Bible studies around the world.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAncient Angelic Technologies, The Wisdom of the Ancients:\nIn this presentation from our Orlando Prophecy Summit, Richard Shaw looks at the archeological evidence of ancient technology and presents the case for it being handed down by the fallen angels described in the book of Genesis.  You can purchase the full set of presentations on DVD by going to our online bookstore at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.prophecyinthenews.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.prophecyinthenews.com&lt;/a&gt;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGod in Ancient China - Parts 1 &amp; 2 (English &amp; Chinese).\nMessage delivered by Rev. (Pastor) Kong Hee (City Harvest Church, Singapore), January/February 2009.  \n\nThis is the full length 2:12 hour presentation delivered by pastor Hee who examines the most ancient Chinese who developed their language, which is still used today, were once worshipers of The Father, Who art in heaven. A very interesting story of their past.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntelligent Design vs Evolution, When Worldviews Collide:\nStephen C. Meyer, PhD, presents evidence on the historical science perspective and the 19th century's rise of its adversary called evolution.  In this funny, yet insightful presentation, Dr. Meyer astutely critiques the problems that our children face as the battle of the sciences is biasly presented in the classroom.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJerusalem Dateline The Business of Peace:\nFeb 7, 2014;  This week on Jerusalem Dateline - The Israeli company that's building a bridge of peace, the international boycott that's targeting the Jewish state, and the Hollywood star who stood by her principles. Plus, meet the Bishop of Baghdad. How Canon ...\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVoices of the Farhud - The 1940 Muslim Genocide of Jews:\nMuslim efforts to exterminate the Jewish people from the world all together is an Islamic duty laid out in the Koran and started in 622 AD. Millions of Jews have been killed since the Islamic prophet was born. So much so that their entire world population in the whole world today is no more than 13 million while the entire Arab peninsula used to be Jewish land.\n\nBut it is not only Jewish people who are target of this extreme racism. It is applied anyone who does not bend to Islam and live under Sharia. For this reason we see the expansion of the Arab Spring, the Muslim effort to re-awaken the Caliphate and remove any religion or rule that is considered non-Islamic.\n\nFarhud (Arabic ??) refers to the pogrom or &quot;violent dispossession&quot; carried out against the Jewish population of Baghdad, Iraq, on June 1--2, 1941. The riots occurred in a power vacuum following the collapse of the pro-Nazi government of Rashid Ali while the city was in a state of instability. Before British and Transjordanian forces arrived, around 2,000 Jews were killed and 1,000's injured. Looting of Jewish property took place and thousands of Jewish homes were destroyed. The actual numbers may be much higher as Arabs lowered the actual figures.\n\nLike the Muslim Armenian genocide of over 2 million Christians, the mass murders and numbers have been ignored as insignificant to Muslim leaders. Why? Because kafirs, a non-Muslim has no official rights or value within Islam, so the murder of non-Muslims is nothing to pay attention to.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 64:\nA folder compiled of various short clips presenting recent apocalyptic signs occurring around the world today to help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal.
