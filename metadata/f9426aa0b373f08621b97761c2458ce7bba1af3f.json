It was released on his album Arc of a Diver and peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and also reached #68 on the Billboard Top 100 for the year 1981, however it only reached #45 in the UK. \n\nOne of the song's most iconic features, its keyboard introduction, was not originally intended to be part of the song. The track was thrown together fairly quickly after Winwood discovered that he had accidentally deleted his intended drum track introduction while preparing for vocals. He wrote a new introduction on the spot as a replacement. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_You_See_a_Chance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_You_See_a_Chance&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 5100kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:56\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
