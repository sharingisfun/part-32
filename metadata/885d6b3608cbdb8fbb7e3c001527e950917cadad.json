The comprehensive survey begins with colonial portraiture and then traces the emergence and development of a national fine arts tradition. There are masterpieces of painting, sculpture, and drawing as well as exquisite examples of American furniture, silver, glass, ceramics and textiles. Architectural presentations include the magnificent marble facade of the Branch Bank of the United States and the living room of a Frank Lloyd Wright Prairie-style house.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:885d6b3608cbdb8fbb7e3c001527e950917cadad","amp;dn":"A+Walk+through+the+American+Wing+%28The+Metropolitan+Museum%29+%28Art+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"885d6b3608cbdb8fbb7e3c001527e950917cadad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,93,107,54,8,203,219,143,187,126,60,0,21,39,233,80,145,124,173,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
