He and Johnny Carson are the only talk program hosts to be seen on a regular basis on United States national television in five consecutive decades, in Cavett's case the 1960s through the 2000s. (While Larry King has also had television talk programs in those decades, the programs he had in the 1960s and 1970s were limited to broadcast on local stations in Miami, WPST and WTVJ.)\n\nIn recent years he has promoted DVDs of his former shows and has hosted replays of his classic TV interviews with Groucho Marx, Katharine Hepburn and others on Turner Classic Movies channel.\n\nThis 4-disc set features 12 episodes from the series featuring interviews with Woody Allen, Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Carol Burnett, Mel Brooks, George Burns, Bill Cosby, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx and The Smothers Brothers. \n\nUPLOADERÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S NOTE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ An odd finishing process prevents these DVDs from ripping perfectly into individual episodes, so that a small portion of one is cut off and included in another. This was too annoying to replicate, so I ripped the last 3 DVDs into single segments of about 3 hours each. There were no subtitles, and the extras were crap, so I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t include them. In the case of Bill Cosby, Groucho Marx, and Woody Allen, there is more than one interview.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c1fdfe9dc57e84efb5c2b73fed72cb26afd50e","amp;dn":"Dick+Cavett+-+Legends+of+Comedy+%28Lucille+Ball%2C+Cosby%2C+Burns%2C+etc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c1fdfe9dc57e84efb5c2b73fed72cb26afd50e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,193,253,254,157,197,126,132,239,181,194,183,63,237,114,203,38,175,213,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
