A key ideological weapon in this development is the cynical and unjustified accusation of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœanti-SemitismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to silence protest and dissent.\n\nFor historical reasons, this tactic has been deployed most forcefully in France, and in the first of the two essays in this book French writers Alain Badiou and Eric Hazan demolish the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœanti-Semitism is everywhereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ claim used to bludgeon critics of the Israeli state and those who stand\nin solidarity with the banlieue youth. In Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Philo-Semitic ReactionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ivan SegrÃƒÂ© undertakes a\nmeticulous deconstruction of a rampant reactionary trend that identifies Jewish interests with the Ã¢â‚¬ËœdemocraticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ West. SegrÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s aim is to uphold a universalist position and to defend Jewish tradition from Zionist ideological distortion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:492c7b26b87ca883216555ff67dd57481ef7188b","amp;dn":"Reflections+On+Anti-Semitism+-+PDF+%2B+EPUB+%2B+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"492c7b26b87ca883216555ff67dd57481ef7188b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,44,123,38,184,124,168,131,33,101,85,255,103,221,87,72,30,247,24,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
