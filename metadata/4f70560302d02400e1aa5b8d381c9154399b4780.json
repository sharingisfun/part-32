The band consisted of Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida), BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Agnetha FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog. They topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982. The name &quot;ABBA&quot; is an acronym formed from the first letters of each of the group members' given names (Agnetha, BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn, Benny, Anni-Frid), and the group took this name officially in late 1973. The group's name is officially trademarked with the first &quot;B&quot; reversed, so that the left and right halves of the name are mirror-images of one another.\nABBA gained international popularity employing catchy song hooks, simple lyrics, sound effects (reverb, phasing) and a Wall of Sound achieved by overdubbing the female singers' voices in multiple harmonies. As their popularity grew, they were sought after to tour Europe, Australia, and North America, drawing crowds of ardent fans, notably in Australia. Touring became a contentious issue, being particularly unpopular with FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog, but they continued to release studio albums to great commercial success. At the height of their popularity, however, both relationships began suffering strain and led to the ultimate collapse of first the Ulvaeus-FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog marriage (in 1979) and then of the Andersson-Lyngstad marriage in 1981, and in the late-70's/ early 80's these relationship changes began manifesting in their music, as they produced more thoughtful, introspective lyrics with different compositions.\nThey remain a fixture of radio playlists and are one of the world's best selling bands, having sold near 370 million records world wide; making them the second best-selling band in history and the second best-selling pop artists in history, they still sell two to four million records a year. ABBA was also the first pop group from mainland Europe to enjoy consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Ireland, South Africa, Rhodesia, Australia and New Zealand. Their enormous popularity subsequently opened the doors for other Continental European acts.\nThe music of ABBA has been re-arranged into the successful musical Mamma Mia! that has toured worldwide and had a movie version released in July 2008 (one of the highest grossing films in the UK). All four of the former members of ABBA were present at the Stockholm premieres of both the musical (2005) and the film (2008). The film premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re took place at the Benny Andersson-owned Rival Theatre at Mariatorget, Stockholm on 4 July 2008. A new museum devoted entirely to the pop supergroup was scheduled to open in Stockholm in 2009, but the project was postponed as of September 2008.\n\n\nABBA Gold: Greatest Hits\n\nABBA Gold: Greatest Hits is a compilation album of recordings by Swedish pop group ABBA, released by PolyGram in 1992, the first compilation to be issued after the company had acquired Polar Music and thus the rights to the ABBA back catalogue. In 1998, PolyGram was in turn merged into what is now the Universal Music Group.\nPrior to its release, all previously released ABBA compilations were deleted and only the original studio albums (along with the 1986 live album) remained in print. It was well received by the music-buying public. ABBA Gold has been re-released in various 'special' or 'remastered' releases in 1999, 2002, a 2003 CD/DVD release, 2004 and 2008. A similar package titled ABBA Oro: Grandes ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°xitos featured ten ABBA songs sung in Spanish.\nABBA Gold is the biggest seller of all ABBA releases, and is one of the Top 30 best-selling albums of all time worldwide. Worldwide sales as of 2009 are 28 million ABBA Gold is the third biggest selling album of all time in the UK as of the end of October 2008, and by June 2009 it had sold 4,610,813 copies. In addition, in the chart of the week beginning 31 May 2009 it was listed at No. 42, which means that it has now occupied every position on the U.K. Top 75 album chart. It is also the best selling album of all time in Switzerland, with certified sales of almost half a million copies there.It is also all time chart champion album in Switzerland for longevity.\nThe original 1992 release included edited versions of &quot;Voulez-Vous&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Game.&quot; These were replaced by the full original-length versions on the 1999 and subsequent re-releases. The original 1992 version is still the only one available in the United States, however. The Australasian release had a modified track list to include three local hits, replacing three other songs. In Spain, the original 1992 release replaced the English versions of &quot;Chiquitita&quot; and &quot;Fernando&quot; with the Spanish language versions.\nIn 1999, the album was also released both worldwide and in Australasia with the different track listings to commemorate ABBA's 25th Anniversary of winning the Eurovision Song Contest with &quot;Waterloo&quot;. This new version was called the 'signature series', as it came with autographs from the band members embedded into the front plastic casing in gold writing. This new version also contained new sleeve notes.\nA 10th Anniversary Edition was released worldwide in 2002. The ABBA logo was changed to the official ABBA font and the back cover was redesigned. It was released in Europe and New Zealand (with the European track list, and not the previous Australasian track list). This version was not released in Australia.\nThe DVD released in 2003 included the 19 songs on the CD, plus the short documentary, ABBA - The History, as well as the 1992 version of the &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; video. This includes scenes from other clips edited into the original video, which was made to promote the original release of ABBA Gold.\nA 30th Anniversary Edition was released in 2004 with a gold-coloured sleeve cover rather than the normal black sleeve. The original release included a DVD with 18 of the 19 songs from the CD, excluding &quot;The Name Of The Game&quot;.\nABBA Gold was re-released in some territories in 2008, coinciding with the release of the film Mamma Mia!. The Australasian release featured the European track list, not the Australasian track list on previous issues.\nThe album topped the UK album chart on five separate occasions, sixteen years apart - first in 1992, then three times in 1999, and then again in 2008. It was also in the UK Top 50 best sellers of 2004. As a result, ABBA Gold is one of the highest selling and longest charting albums released in the United Kingdom. By 2008, it had become the fourth longest charting album of all time, and by week beginning 20 September 2009, it had totalled 438 weeks in the Top 100.\nOn July 24, 2008, it also topped for the first time the US Top Pop Catalog Albums charts, being its first #1 ever in any one of Billboard's Album charts, previously peaking at #17 on the Billboard Comprehensive Albums charts, where it finally peaked at #11.\nIn the Irish Album Chart, the album - as of 23 January 2008 - has been in the top 100 best selling albums for 426 weeks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f70560302d02400e1aa5b8d381c9154399b4780","amp;dn":"ABBA+-+Abba+Gold+-+Greatest+Hits+%281992%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvilla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f70560302d02400e1aa5b8d381c9154399b4780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,112,86,3,2,208,36,0,225,170,91,141,56,28,145,84,57,155,71,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
