It was created by Stephen Sullivan and Tim Truman, with Truman providing the covers (along with the layouts for #1). According to the cover blurb:\n\n'NEWSTRALIA is a tale of rebellion and deceit in the far future. It is also the name of a new supercontinent, a hostile world filled with famine, mutants, and the malevolent Iron Church -- and three unlikely heroes. Their plan? Survival.'\n\nMultiple thanks to the creative teams and the scanners! Get it, seed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21838ca5079981f0bc8baa7c440c2c56f4a9cecc","amp;dn":"Newstralia+%28Innovation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21838ca5079981f0bc8baa7c440c2c56f4a9cecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,131,140,165,7,153,129,240,188,139,170,124,68,12,44,86,244,169,206,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
