June 11] 1889 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ March 5, 1966), better known by the pen name Anna Akhmatova, was a Russian modernist poet, one of the most acclaimed writers in the Russian canon.\n\nAkhmatova's work ranges from short lyric poems to intricately structured cycles, such as Requiem (1935Ã¢â‚¬â€œ40), her tragic masterpiece about the Stalinist terror. Her style, characterised by its economy and emotional restraint, was strikingly original and distinctive to her contemporaries. The strong and clear leading female voice struck a new chord in Russian poetry. Her writing can be said to fall into two periods Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the early work (1912Ã¢â‚¬â€œ25) and her later work (from around 1936 until her death), divided by a decade of reduced literary output. Her work was condemned and censored by Stalinist authorities and she is notable for choosing not to emigrate, and remaining in Russia, acting as witness to the atrocities around her. Her perennial themes include meditations on time and memory, and the difficulties of living and writing in the shadow of Stalinism.\n\nBetween 1935 and 1940 Akhmatova composed, worked and reworked the long poem Requiem in secret, a lyrical cycle of lamentation and witness, depicting the suffering of the common people under Soviet terror. She carried it with her as she worked and lived in towns and cities across the Soviet Union. It was conspicuously absent from her collected works, given its explicit condemnation of the purges. The work in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987.It consists of ten numbered poems that examine a series of emotional states, exploring suffering, despair, devotion, rather than a clear narrative. Biblical themes such as Christ's crucifixion and the devastation of Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdelene, reflect the ravaging of Russia, particularly witnessing the harrowing of women in the 1930s. It represented, to some degree, a rejection of her own earlier romantic work as she took on the public role as chronicler of the Terror. This is a role she holds to this day.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Evening, Poetry of Anna Akhmatova, Translated by Andrey Kneller (2014)\n\n* Fifteen Poems of Anna Akhmatova, Translated by Graeme Davis (2013)\n\n* Final Meeting, Selected Poetry of Anna Akhmatova, Translated by Andrey Kneller   (2014)\n\n* Rosary, Poetry of Anna Akhmatova, Translated by Andrey Kneller  (2014)\n\n* The Word That Causes Death's Defeat, Poems of Memory (Yale University Press,2004)\n\n* White Flock, Poetry of Anna Akhmatova, Translated by Andrey Kneller  (2014)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/books/review/19grushin.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/books/review/19grushin.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Akhmatova&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Akhmatova&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/31/biography.features&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jul/31/biography.features&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b781d22012d5dcc5f0f5e3fa02c544ff6bc12488","amp;dn":"Anna+Akhmatova+-+Russian+Poet+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b781d22012d5dcc5f0f5e3fa02c544ff6bc12488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,129,210,32,18,213,220,197,240,245,227,250,2,197,68,255,107,193,36,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
