Most kids were infatuated with the look of Kiss, not their music. Decked out in outrageously flamboyant costumes and makeup, the band fashioned a captivating stage show featuring dry ice, smoke bombs, elaborate lighting, blood spitting, and fire breathing that captured the imaginations of thousands of kids. But Kiss' music shouldn't be dismissed -- it was a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings. It was a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late '80s.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tStar Mark\nCatalog:\t\t22278-1/2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA &amp; 99.94% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.A World Without Heroes\n02.Strutter\n03.Nothin' To Lose\n04.Deuce\n05.Black Diamond\n06.Parasite\n07.Hotter Than Hell\n08.C'Mon And Love Me\n09.Rock Bottom (Live)\n10.Rock And Roll All Nite (Live)\n11.Detroit Rock City\n12.Shout It Out Loud\n13.Beth\n14.Calling Dr. Love\n15.Hard Luck Woman\n16.I Stole Your Love\n17.Love Gun\n18.Tonight You Belong To Me\n19.New York Groove\n20.I Was Made For Lovin' You\n21.Sure Know Something\n22.Shandi\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.We Are One\n02.I Love It Loud\n03.Lick It Up\n04.Heaven's On Fire\n05.Tears Are Falling\n06.Crazy, Crazy Nights\n07.Reason To Live\n08.Let's Put The X In Sex\n09.Rise To It\n10.Hide Your Heart\n11.Forever\n12.Domino\n13.I Just Wanna\n14.God Gave Rock 'N' Roll To You II\n15.I Still Love You (Live Unplugged)\n16.Jungle\n17.I Will Be There\n18.Psycho Circus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec285179e44ca9b13fc966fe41dee7887b7fcfc0","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec285179e44ca9b13fc966fe41dee7887b7fcfc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,40,81,121,228,76,169,177,63,201,102,254,65,222,231,136,123,127,207,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
