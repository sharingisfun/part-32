It could be an exciting change.\r\n\r\nOr maybe not.\r\n\r\nEspecially when that roommate is the cold and seemingly calculating Bridgette. Tensions run high and tempers flare as the two can hardly stand to be in the same room together. But Warren has a theory about Bridgette: anyone who can hate with that much passion should also have the capability to love with that much passion. And he wants to be the one to test this theory.\r\n\r\nWill Bridgette find it in herself to warm her heart to Warren and finally learn to love?\r\n\r\nMaybe.\r\n\r\nMaybe not","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f7bc7c962ef9b80601ec0c29d477afe685cc72","amp;dn":"Maybe+Series+Audiobooks+%281-1.5%29+by+Colleen+Hoover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f7bc7c962ef9b80601ec0c29d477afe685cc72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,247,188,124,150,46,249,184,6,1,236,12,41,212,119,175,230,133,204,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
