It sank after being torpedoed by the Soviet submarine S-13 on 30 January 1945.\n\nThe ship was named after Wilhelm Gustloff, the assassinated German leader of the Swiss Nazi party. It was requisitioned into the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) on 1 September 1939 and served as a hospital ship during 1939 and 1940. Beginning on 20 November 1940, it was stripped of medical equipment and repainted from its hospital ship colors (white with a green stripe) to standard naval grey. The Wilhelm Gustloff was then assigned as a floating barracks for naval personnel in Nazi occupied Poland in the port of Gdynia (renamed during German occupation to Gotenhafen), near Danzig (now GdaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾sk in Poland), from 1940 onwards.\n\nThe Wilhelm Gustloff\\'s final voyage was during Operation Hannibal in January 1945, when it was sunk while participating in the evacuation of military personnel, Nazi officials and civilians who were surrounded by the Red Army in East Prussia. The Gustloff was hit by three torpedoes from the Soviet submarine S-13 in the Baltic Sea on the night of 30 January 1945 and sank in less than 45 minutes. An estimated 9,400 people were killed in the sinking. If accurate, this would be the largest known loss of life occurring during a single ship sinking in recorded maritime history.\n\nNow, NGC examines the events leading up to the catastrophe and looks for answers to the mystery surrounding the fateful night.\n\nExecutive Producer Guido Knopp\nDirector Christian Frey\nZDF Production in association with ZDF Enterprises (2008)\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2170 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 45:33.992\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 811,451,646 Bytes\nEncoded by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6670decab16b0a807d2fb03879734b8a8bd36e27","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Sinking.Hitler%5C%27s.Supership.XviD.AC3.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6670decab16b0a807d2fb03879734b8a8bd36e27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,112,222,202,177,107,10,128,125,47,176,56,121,115,75,138,139,211,110,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
