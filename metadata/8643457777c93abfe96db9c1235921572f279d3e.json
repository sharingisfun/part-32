Each story is accompanied by forewords or afterwords, written especially for this edition, and designed to pravide useful background information and unique insights into the mind of the artist. Moebius has been involved every step of the way, making this the definitive collection of his works.\nLater volumes will also boast the first appearance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ even before they see publication in France ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«colorizedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ versions of stories that previously were printed in black-and-white, such as The Airtight Garage, Major Fatal, etc. Again, Moebius supervised every step of the coloring, often choosing each color used on the entire page.\nAs to this volume, Upon a Star and its short prequel, The Repairmen, it is the first chapter of a new cosmic saga entitled The Aedena Cycle. The second chapter, The Gardens of Aedena, will be Volume 5 in this series. The Aedena Cycle will eventually link up with other Moebius works, inciuding The Airtight Garage, to form the basis of a coherent Moebius Universe.\nAs we said, this is the first stÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©p in a new journey. Please, travel along with us.&quot;\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nATTENTION FELLOW PIRATES:\n\nSome *ssholes are performing automated swarm attacks on mine and other users torrents.
