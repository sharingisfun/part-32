Spackman draws from many stories for inspiration, exploring voices of the earth and its children to illuminate how one voice is made by many through conversation and connection. Her voice has grown in maturity and confidence, and tumbles through her melodies with intention and playfulness. Self-recorded and produced, SpackmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work features excellent singers and instrumentalists, including her friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cello and her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drums. The attention to detail is evident in the complex, rich layering of different sounds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each song seems to reach the place it was intended for. This lovingly created collection of stories and messages is empowering, inspiring, and is a versatile soundtrack for everything from road trips to rainy days.\nSpackman hopes you will listen to Her Voice, share your own, and make a connection or two. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce931cbf975dfc057dce8053da889f4e5714dcbb","amp;dn":"Anna+Spackman+-+Her+Voice+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce931cbf975dfc057dce8053da889f4e5714dcbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,147,28,191,151,93,252,5,125,206,128,83,218,136,159,78,87,20,220,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
