Car Wash Hair (The Bee&amp;#039;s Chasing Me)\n\nQuote:\nMercury Rev, originating from upstate New York and featuring John Donahue on guitar and Dave Fridmann on bass, achieved a synthesis of historical proportions. Yerself Is Steam (1991) was a psychedelic extravaganza that spanned three decades and three continents. Emotionally, it ran the gamut from Red Krayola&amp;#039;s anarchic freak-outs to contemplative/meditative ecstases in the vein of new-age music. Technically, it blended and alternated pop melody, ambient droning, mind-boggling distortion, oneiric folk, martial tempos, pastoral passages, infernal noise and lyrical lullabies. Far from being merely a nostalgic tribute to an age, Mercury Rev&amp;#039;s operation started with the hippie vision of nirvana on the other side of a swirling and chaotic music, but tempered the optimism of that program with an awareness of the human condition, and poisoned it with fits of neurosis and decadent atmospheres. - Piero Scaruffi -\n\n\nQuote:\n&amp;#039;This quintet&amp;#039;s debut album is earth-shattering. Absolutely stunning&amp;#039; - Vox.\n&amp;#039;This may have been where the last ten years have been leadingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Mercury Rev soar over the heads of their forerunners&amp;#039; - Album Of The Month, Select.\n&amp;#039;A bit like nothing you&amp;#039;ve heard in your life. Sprawlingly magnificent.&amp;#039; - Melody Maker\n&amp;#039;Truly a gorgeous one. This is going to be well up on the list this year.&amp;#039; - Sounds\n&amp;#039;It sounds great, a bold, mangled noiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a fine entrance.&amp;#039; - NME\n&amp;#039;Retraces the time when music and drugs were celebrated as harbingers of a mind-expanding new order. The dream state of the record sticks in your memory even after you awake, and the muse behind the band&amp;#039;s ambitions always shines genuine and triumphant. - CMJ - cover.\n\n\nNote: &quot;Car Wash Hair&quot; appears as track 99 on 1992 Sony/Columbia version of the album. Also, on this same version, &quot;Very Sleepy Rivers&quot; is divided into fragments between tracks 8-98.\n\nTo make the files manageable I ripped the album as a wav image and split with GoldWave.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05dc7428d73950e572c88bc415c35ef09cf139ee","amp;dn":"Mercury+Rev+-+Yerself+Is+Steam+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05dc7428d73950e572c88bc415c35ef09cf139ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,220,116,40,215,57,80,229,114,200,139,196,21,195,94,240,156,241,57,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
