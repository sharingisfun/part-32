Befriended by her fellow maids, she triesÃ¢â‚¬â€and failsÃ¢â‚¬â€to avoid attention while awaiting the return of the duke, her father's friend. Discovering the life of gentility she had known was a virtual fairy tale, reality a dark and forbidding place, Lisa faces danger at every turn.\n\nCaptivated by the beautiful maid, Nathaniel Stanton, the Marquis of Marsden, decides the only way to protect the new girl is by offering her his protection. With her reputation ruined and all hope of returning to her previous station seemingly lost, Lisa surrenders her virtue to the man she has come to love almost beyond reason. Finding unexpected passion in Nathaniel's arms, her senses are awakened to a world of sensuality she had not known existed. A world not without grave risks.\n\nBelieving it is the only way he can keep her in his life, Nathaniel asks Lisa to be his mistress, promising her a home and a future with him . . . of sorts. Despite her misgivings about its dubious morality, she accepts the position rather than be separated from Nathaniel. But her father's heir, Lord Copeland, has not given up in his quest to have her for himself.\n\nWith her freedom, Nathaniel's position in society, and the future of countless others at stake, she must sacrifice her future happiness and find a way to disappear forever. If her identity is uncovered, Lisa's innocence won't be the only thing that's lost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f08ff1cb8000328626b89d00e6b74f5cd9dc7aa","amp;dn":"Innocence+-+Elise+De+Sallier.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f08ff1cb8000328626b89d00e6b74f5cd9dc7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,8,255,28,184,0,3,40,98,107,137,208,14,107,116,245,205,157,199,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
