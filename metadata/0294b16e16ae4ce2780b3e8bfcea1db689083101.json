This created a stalemate in the world similar to the Cold War of the '80s. The Allies now have Generation 1 technology and the Axis were at Generation 3 technology.&quot;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0294b16e16ae4ce2780b3e8bfcea1db689083101","amp;dn":"Paolo+Parente%27s+Dust+02+of+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0294b16e16ae4ce2780b3e8bfcea1db689083101","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,148,177,110,22,174,76,226,120,11,62,139,252,234,29,182,137,8,49,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
