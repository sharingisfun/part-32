You can also remove the RPC region code, thereby making the movie region free and viewable on any DVD player and with any DVD player software. \n\nAnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including subtitles and prohibition messages such as copyright and FBI warnings. It also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or remove a disc, or prevent 'PC-friendly' software from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD. \n\nDecryption is not all that AnyDVD offers. You can control the drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching movies on your PC. You can even adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays. \n\nBut AnyDVD doesn't just stop at DVDs, it also fixes intentionally broken audio CDs to allow you to play and copy them. \n\nFeatures\nWorks automatically in the background\nRemoves encryption (CSS) and region code (RPC) from DVDs\nRemoves analogue copy protection (Macrovision)\nRemoves features such as forced subtitles and warnings\nDecrypts without the need to save the data onto your hard-disk\nDecrypts 'on the fly'\nPrevents automatic launching of 'PC-friendly' software on video DVDs\nAllows adjustment of your monitor refresh rate for both NTSC and PAL monitors\nAllows execution of external programs on disc insertion and removal\nAllows speed control of your DVD drives\nCompatible with all DVD media\nWorks with all DVD-drives, regardless of region code\nWorks with all DVD copying, such as CloneDVD, and all DVD player software\nWorks transparently for the operating system: DVDs can be shared over the network and copied with the command prompt or with Windows Explorer, etc.\nProven to be stable and fast and does not require an ASPI driver\nProvides its own Universal Disk Format (UDF) reader.
