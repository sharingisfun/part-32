Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his later works, Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences and addressed the nature of drug use, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536ef88af3ba4c8482a52fe1fbba94544104eda8","amp;dn":"Philip+K.+Dick+-+Collection+%2847+eBooks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536ef88af3ba4c8482a52fe1fbba94544104eda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,110,248,138,243,186,76,132,130,165,47,225,251,186,148,84,65,4,237,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
