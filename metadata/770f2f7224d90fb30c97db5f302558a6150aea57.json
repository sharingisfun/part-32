Once the main program is ran in safe mode it would run the command to remove safe boot. But if a user couldn't get logged in for some reason, or they didn't run the main program in safe mode they would always boot into safe mode. One way out of safe mode was to use msconfig.exe to remove it. but if the user couldn't get logged in then they where stuck.\r\nSo I have built a new service that is installed when you tell the main program to boot into safe mode. \r\n\r\n- The new files (TweakingRemoveSafeBoot_32.exe and TweakingRemoveSafeBoot_64.exe) will install as a service and when they run (Services can run at the login screen) they will run the &quot;bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot&quot; command and then remove itself as a service. (They do NOT stay installed as a service on the system, they run once and then are removed)\r\nThis should now keep any users from getting stuck in safe mode :-)\r\n\r\n- Updated Default Permissions for Windows 10 to the newest Windows Updates. Microsoft seems to be pushing out updates almost every day or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOS: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 (32 &amp; 64 Bit)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nInstaller: (20.22 MB)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:770f2f7224d90fb30c97db5f302558a6150aea57","amp;dn":"Tweaking.com+Windows+Repair+PRO+3.7.0+%2B+Serial+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"770f2f7224d90fb30c97db5f302558a6150aea57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,15,47,114,36,217,15,179,12,151,219,95,48,37,88,166,21,10,234,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
