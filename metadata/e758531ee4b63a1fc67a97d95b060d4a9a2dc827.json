How the Foreign Office has sought over the years to come to terms with Britain's reduced status in the world makes an often tragicomic tale.\n\nCockerell blends fresh access filming, rare and previously unseen archive and interviews with past and present foreign secretaries and their normally camera-shy senior officials. The film tells of the many behind-the-scenes battles in the FO between its mandarins and ministers and against 10 Downing Street.\n\nSuccessive prime ministers have regarded the Foreign Office as temperamentally inclined to kow-tow to foreigners and have sought to be their own foreign secretaries - often with disastrous consequences. The film also explores the always-uneasy relationship between the FO and its offshoot, Britain's spy agency, MI6.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760\nFrames per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192Kbps 48KHz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59mins\nPart Size: 760MB\nNumber of Parts: 3\nSubtitles: Merged and SRT\nripped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-T\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e758531ee4b63a1fc67a97d95b060d4a9a2dc827","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+Offices+of+State+2of3+PDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e758531ee4b63a1fc67a97d95b060d4a9a2dc827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,88,83,30,228,182,58,31,198,122,151,217,91,6,13,74,154,45,200,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
