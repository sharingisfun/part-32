VENEGAS\n\nI've been looking for this album for a long time... Believe it or not, I found it brand new on a &quot;Clearance&quot; basket in a small CD shop. The salesman almost told me with his eyes, &quot;I wouldn't bother if you ask me to pay anything you carry in your pockets for that CD&quot;... I didn't hesitate and asked for a discount, the salesman took out the Sale Price sticker and told me, &quot;give me any money you have and take it, but right now!&quot;\n\nWow, what an album! WHAT A VOICE! Man, this Paul Carrack knows how to perform good music, and even better, how TO SING IT!!!! If you like Mike and The Mechanics, Squeeze, Ace and those rare 70s British musical 'artifacts', get this album! It's a must-have!!!!\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaul Carrack - Blue Views\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Paul Carrack\nAlbum................: Blue Views\nGenre................: Blues\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1995\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 254kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
