Naturally, there are no Beatles cuts on here, but the disc opens conservatively enough with a Cilla Black version of an orphaned Lennon/McCartney song, &quot;Love of the Loved,&quot; and then steps into slightly less familiar territory with the Fourmost's rendition of the pair's &quot;I'm in Love.&quot; From there, it gets a lot more interesting. The Dakotas (sans Billy J. Kramer) show themselves to be a first-rate, hard-rocking instrumental outfit on &quot;The Cruel Sea,&quot; which showcases original lead guitarist Mike Maxfield. Jimmy Page's lead guitar is the focal point of a killer cover of &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; by Birmingham's Pat Wayne &amp; the Beachcombers, who eventually evolved into Keith Powell &amp; the Valets, who left behind the sweetly sung ballad &quot;The Answer Is No&quot; (also featured here). Among the other fair-to-middling finds here is the Toggery Five's &quot;I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys,&quot; a surprisingly lyrical piece of pop fluff by Andrew Loog Oldham and Keith Richards. Manfred Mann's seldom-heard &quot;Tired of Trying, Bored With Lying, Scared of Dying&quot; is one of the fiercer rock &amp; roll numbers left behind by this most musically articulate of British beat bands, with a raucous performance all around (especially by soon-to-depart guitarist Mike Vickers). Beryl Marsden represents the fairer sex on this compilation with a lung-searing performance of &quot;Break-A-Way&quot; that's one of the most exciting records of its period. Her future Shotgun Express stablemate Rod Stewart closes this jewel of a disc with &quot;The Day Will Come,&quot; an oddball 1965 single whose majestic orchestral backing suggests that evidently someone was thinking of Stewart as a potential rival to Tom Jones.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/beat-at-abbey-road-1963-1965-r342196/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/beat-at-abbey-road-1963-1965-r342196/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000007VA5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000007VA5&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
