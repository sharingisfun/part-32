It goes into such detail, any user is almost guaranteed success. One could write a full review just of this book. For example, within its 18 chapters we can find out how to install, use, and customize the desktop, connect to the internet, and manage files and the system. But that's not all. It also details how to use all the various applications. And it all focuses on point and click. I haven't seen a reference to the commandline yet. This book appears to be a wonderful asset. The User Guide alone is probably worth the price of the Xandros package to the new Linux user.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e8269ea1e424de46157070977c4b7efa7d4d0e","amp;dn":"Xandros+4+Desktop+User-Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53e8269ea1e424de46157070977c4b7efa7d4d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,232,38,158,161,228,36,222,70,21,112,112,151,124,75,126,250,125,77,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
