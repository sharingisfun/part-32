The rise of cultural Marxism/multiculturalism in Western Europe\n\n2. Why the Islamic colonization and Islamisation of Western Europe began\n\n3. The current state of the Western European Resistance Movements \n(anti-  Marxist/anti-Jihadmovements)\n\n4. Solutions for Western Europe and how we, the resistance, should move forward  in the coming decades\n\n5. Covering all, highly relevant topics including solutions and strategies for all of the 8 different political fronts\n\n\nThe compendium/book presents advanced ideological, practical, tactical, organisational and rhetorical solutions and strategies for all patriotic-minded individuals/movements.\n\nThe book will be of great interest to you whether you are a moderate or a more\ndedicated cultural conservative/nationalist.\n\nIncluded are also demographical studies, historical statistics, forecasts and insights on various subjects related to the ongoing and future struggle of Europe. It covers most topics related to historical events and aspects of past and current \n\nIslamic Imperialism, which is now removed or falsified by our academia by instruction of Western EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cultural relativist elites (cultural relativism=cultural Marxism). \n\nIt offers thorough analysis of Islam, which is unknown to a majority of Europeans. It documents how the political doctrines known as multiculturalism/cultural Marxism/cultural relativism was created and implemented. \n\nMulticulturalists/cultural Marxists usually operate under the disguise of\nhumanism. A majority are anti-nationalists and want to deconstruct European identity,traditions, culture and even nation states.\n\nAs we all know, the root of Europe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s problems is the lack of cultural self-confidence (nationalism). Most people are still terrified of nationalistic political doctrines thinking that if we ever embrace these principles again, new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHitlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will suddenly pop up and initiate global Armageddon... Needless to say; the growing numbers of nationalists in W.Europe are systematically being ridiculed, silenced and persecuted by the current cultural\nMarxist/multiculturalist political establishments. \n\n\nThis has been a continuous ongoing process which started in 1945. This irrational fear of nationalistic doctrines is preventing us from stopping our own national/cultural suicide as the Islamic colonization is increasing annually. \n\n\n\nThis book presents the only solutions to our current problems.\nYou cannot defeat Islamisation or halt/reverse the Islamic colonization of Western Europe without first removing the political doctrines manifested through multiculturalism/cultural MarxismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:add38df6136c5c29dbb4e2fc806ab558140414ef","amp;dn":"2083+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+A+European+Declaration+of+Independence+by+Anders+Behrin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"add38df6136c5c29dbb4e2fc806ab558140414ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,211,141,246,19,108,92,41,219,180,226,252,128,106,181,88,20,4,20,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
