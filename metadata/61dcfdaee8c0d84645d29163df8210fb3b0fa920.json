Though the flesh is a little weak at times in the trumpeters, the spirit is fortunately more than willing, and plenty of their inimitable trademarks -- Edison's terse repeated notes and Terry's slippery phrases -- come through in this swinging, blues-dominated mainstream session. Wess is in fine shape on flute and tenor, and pianist Mance contributes a lot of sturdy, stirring, two-fisted blues and a lovely, searching interpretation of &quot;Emily.&quot; Edison wrote half of the eight songs on the disc -- three blues (including his standard &quot;Centerpiece&quot;) and a pleasing token bossa nova (&quot;Sweets' Bossa&quot;). If this gig often has the joyous ambience (and occasional signatures) of a Basie jam, why not?; all three horns are Basie alums. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Helena's Theme\n02 - Means Greens\n03 - Sweets Bossa\n04 - Doggin' Around\n05 - Emily\n06 - Midgets\n07 - I Wish I Knew\n08 - Centerpiece\n\nEnjoy and share!
