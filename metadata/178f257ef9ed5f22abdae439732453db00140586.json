After The Fire's version (promo posted:) featured English lyrics by the band's Andy Piercy. The song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. \n\nJohann (Hans) Holzel (19 February 1957 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian pop and rock musician and rapper. He had several international hits: &quot;Der Kommissar&quot;, &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;, &quot;Vienna Calling&quot;, &quot;Jeanny&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Musik&quot;, &quot;Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2)&quot; and posthumously, &quot;Out Of The Dark&quot;. \n\nHe is the first and only artist to date whose principal language was German to score a number-one hit in the United States with &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;. His estate claims he has sold 40 million albums and 20 million singles to date, which makes him the best selling Austrian singer of all time.\n(video has a blue/white &quot;vintage music line&quot; logo at the bottom left &amp; a white &quot;mediaset&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Kommissar_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Kommissar_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DakGiAaDN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DakGiAaDN&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8241kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:36\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
