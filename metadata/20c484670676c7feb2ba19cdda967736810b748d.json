Ten musicians participate in the project ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ nine lads from Latvia and a lone Estonian girl. The idea of the group is to develop bagpipe and drum music in Latvia. The word auÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i has two meanings in Latvian: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“gallopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, representing the rhythm of drums; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“beehives on the treeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - the sound of drones. There is scarce physical evidence left of bagpipe and drum playing traditions in Latvia, though the playing of both instruments is mentioned frequently in Latvian folklore materials.\n\nAuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i mostly plays instrumental music. As a source for inspiration, the group uses traditional bagpipe, dance and song melodies of Latvian and other European nations. The music reflects AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creative approach and the contemporary feel of traditional culture. Latvians have an exceptionally rich vocal tradition and a few of these songs, with some percussion pieces, appear in the repertoire. In the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performances you can hear the traditional Latvian bagpipe playing technique called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“elbowingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, low-tension stump drums (the biggest in the Baltics!) and various types of percussion instruments traditional to the Baltic region, with appearances by the Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â£Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â«ga (trough fiddle), jewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harp, cymbals, and gongs. (more &gt; instruments)\n\n\nShort History of Auli\n\nThe group members came together in the spring of 2003, and their first performance occurred at the 750 year celebrations of the city of LiepÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ja on LatviaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s western coast. By the next performance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the world music festival, Vendene, in CÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Å“sis later that summer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the ensemble had gained the name AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i. After a month came the first performance in Lithuania at the festival Menuo Jodaragis. And another month later the group played in the Baltijas Saule festival (RÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â«ga) dedicated to the unity of Balts. Concerts in Estonia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tallinn and Tartu - followed and AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i concluded 2003 with a performance at the Folklore Award Ceremony. Intense concert activity and growth of the ensemble began. AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i soon performed in front of a variety of audiences: For children in schools throughout Latvia, exploring the history of their instruments.\nLatvian official state celebrations and city festivals: LiepÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ja, Ventspils, the CÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Å“sis 800 celebration, Sigulda, Valmiera, Valka, Aizpute, LÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â«vÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ni, RÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â«ga.\nMusic festivals in Latvia: Baltijas saule, RozÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ peldbaseins, Bauzland, Porta world music festival, Vendene, the Baltic Medieval Festival\nLithuania: Menuo Jodaragis, Apuole, Kilkim Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½aibu; Estonia: MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tofest, NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµmme Kevadfolk; Poland: Czeremczina, SkrzyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¼owanie Kultur Warszawa\nRussia: St PatrickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s day festival in St Petersbourg\nChina: The Star Live Concert Hall, Beijing.\nClubs: Depo, Tonuss, Fontaine Palace\nPresentation of NATO summit 2007 logo.\nProjects of popular Latvian composers: Juris Kulakovs, Valts PÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«ce, MÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½rtiÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ Brauns, ZigmÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½rs LiepiÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡, Raimonds Tiguls, PÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Å“teris ButÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ns.\nIn 2008 AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i performed at the four-yearly Latvian Song and Dance Festival opening and gala concert (one of biggest musical events in Latvia) together with 12,000 singers. Renowned documentary director Askolds SaulÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â«tis made the first video of the group, released in 2007. Their second CD AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼osÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ won the Recording CompanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Music Award for Best Contemporary Folk Music album in 2007.\nMusical Style\n\nPretty rare in music nowdays, bagpipes and traditional drums should sound loud and powerful - good for big social celebrations, one would think. And so it happens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music fits well at big social events, city festivals, national celebrations as well as in traditional music festivals and on stage together with rock groups and orchestra. The group has been invited to play at weddings and funerals tooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ By developing new techniques of playing drums and bagpipes together, AuÃƒâ€žÃ‚Â¼i has expanded the possibilities of these instruments and created their own distinctive style. Influences from different styles including rock, metal, ethnotrance, medieval and world music can be heard in the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recordings and performances.\n\nThe closest analogue to such music can be found cultures of Celtic regions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Scotland, Ireland, Bretagne, Galicia. The sounds of bagpipe and drum playing through these areas differs considerably due to a range of construction techniques and use of instruments. Some similar groups can be found in Germany, but they rely on a foundation of medieval music and combine this with rock and pop music elements and use a wider range of instruments such as guitars, harps, synthesisers, etc.\n\nOFFICIAL WEBSITE: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.auli.lv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.auli.lv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---___---\n\nAn album &quot;SendzirdÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Å“ju&quot;\n(Lauska 2005; mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\n1.
