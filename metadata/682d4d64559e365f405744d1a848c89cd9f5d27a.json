A set list from the How it Feels to Be Something On tour, it was recorded on May 26, 1999, in Eugene, OR and released in the same year on Sub Pop. The VHS included the promo videos for Seven and In Circles. Sunny Day Real Estate was apparently displeased with the outcome of the record. However, their label Sub Pop apparently did not run the record by the band before releasing it to the public. This record is allegedly the reason why Sunny Day Real Estate left Sub Pop for another label.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Pillars&quot; 5:01\n   2. &quot;Guitar and Video Games&quot;  4:18\n   3. &quot;The Blankets Were the Stairs&quot;  5:48\n   4. &quot;100 million&quot;  5:37\n   5. &quot;Every Shining Time You Arrive&quot;  4:31\n   6. &quot;Song About an Angel&quot; 6:21\n   7. &quot;The Prophet&quot;  6:02\n   8. &quot;J'Nuh&quot;  5:48\n   9. &quot;Rodeo Jones&quot;  5:08\n  10. &quot;In Circles&quot;  5:00\n  11. &quot;Days Were Golden&quot;  8:42\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682d4d64559e365f405744d1a848c89cd9f5d27a","amp;dn":"Sunny+Day+Real+Estate+-+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682d4d64559e365f405744d1a848c89cd9f5d27a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,45,77,100,85,158,54,95,64,87,68,209,168,72,200,156,217,245,210,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
