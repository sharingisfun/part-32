And while &quot;Make You Mad&quot; does sound a little too convincingly like Badfinger, all of these tunes are squarely rooted in the '90s. Unlike previous efforts which left you feeling just a wee bit &quot;odd,&quot; Nest makes you feel like you've just come home after a long journey and everything is familiar and in its place. The best thing to say is simply &quot;Enjoy!&quot; (3.5/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdea0361a8fb27f3299b403dd5eae44aa75d312b","amp;dn":"Odds+-+Nest+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdea0361a8fb27f3299b403dd5eae44aa75d312b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,234,3,97,168,251,39,243,41,155,64,61,213,234,228,74,167,93,49,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
