Number Three on the List of Alien Outlaws takes the form of raging, soul-possessing fire. And fire transports Daniel back to the most traumatic event of his life-the death of his parents. \n\nIn the face of his &quot;kryptonite&quot;, Daniel struggles with his extraordinary powers like never before, and more than ever is at stake: his best friends are in grave peril. The only way to save them is to travel back-through a hole in time-to the demon's arrival during the Dark Ages. Rip-roaring action and humor sets the pages afire in this gripping time-travel adventure with an Arthurian cast-and countless other surprises!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6cbe1b5a30552a25c9e1ca0e859e4249ec216e6","amp;dn":"Daniel+X%3A+Demons+and+Druids+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6cbe1b5a30552a25c9e1ca0e859e4249ec216e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,203,225,181,163,5,82,162,92,158,28,160,232,89,228,36,158,194,22,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
