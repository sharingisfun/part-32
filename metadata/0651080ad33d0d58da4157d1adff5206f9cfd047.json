Amazingly, Chad graduated and began working in local radio and television.. but was fired from nearly every job for being a smart-ass. Eventually, he began to realize that he needed to find work where this kind of behavior was appreciated and decided to embrace poverty and pursue comedy. He found both in Nashville, where after doing open mics for only a few months, Riden had regular bookings at Zanies Comedy Showplace.\n\nSoon, Chad could be found performing everywhere from a tent in a Wal-Mart parking lot to the historic Ryman Auditorium. Chad has since opened for Dave Attell, Doug Stanhope, and Bill Burr; has appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman's &quot;Tony Mendez Show&quot;; and tours the nation using his smart-ass super powers for good, not evil.\n\nThe Nashville Scene wrote, &quot;His aggressive, angry-young-man stance of a few years ago has been leavened somewhat, since Riden more recently entered the world of marriage and fatherhood. His observations on the domestic sphere teeter amiably on the edge, but when he wants to, Riden can still zing pop culture, the media and American life in general with incisive wit.&quot;http://www.Twitter.com/ChadRiden\nhttp://www.ChadRiden.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0651080ad33d0d58da4157d1adff5206f9cfd047","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Chad+Riden+-+FREEdumb+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0651080ad33d0d58da4157d1adff5206f9cfd047","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,81,8,10,211,61,13,88,218,65,87,209,173,255,82,6,249,207,208,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
