That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 800-850gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\n================================\n   I though I'd tell you a couple things about my scan selection process, a nice break from my more personal rant last time. Let me preface this by saying I am very grateful to every single scanner for doing their work. I would never criticize any scanner by name, and don't mean to condemn anyone by implication. I also recognize that people have to practice and may not have the best scanners or the best editing software. I'm sure everyone is doing the best they can, and hurray for every one of you.\n     For myself, I prefer cover to cover, though I care a great deal less about modern comics than tho old ones, as the new ones have no nostalgia or curiosity value. I sometimes read old letter columns and other features too that are sometimes left out of less complete scans. I'd like my reading experience too be as close as possible to having the original comic, even to the point that I kind of like it when they look their age. \n     If I find the c-to-c scan has particular issues that make it a poorer choice, I keep alternate incomplete scans that are better. There are not t0o many such, as many older comics have no alternates, and most new comics scans are fine although alternates abound. I will default toward the larger of two scans that look about the same to me, as in most cases the larger one has higher quality images. There are limits to quality, though. Just today I tossed a scan that was over 100mb for a standard comic. Imagine if every comics was that size. I like a size of 15-20mbs for a standard comcis. Not much more than 512k per page seems good to me as a rule of thumb. A lot of scans are closer to twice that. Too big for my disk budget when you have the number of comics I have. Scans under 10mb for a standard comics are usually noticeably inferior. For this reason I have fewer minuteman scans. They are typically much larger and rarely cover to cover. They often are visibly better, as per their claim, but life has it's tradeoffs. In summary this series is not the best scans out there, even in my opinion.  I want completeness over quality within reason, hence the duplicate I have kept sometimes.\n\n     Old comics are a problem. The problem with old ones is two-fold. First many of them were made in the early days of scanning, when hard drive space was at a premium, and the file size was very small as a result. Big is not always better, but you can only go so small w/o reducing quality. Just ask your wife. Modern scanners save better quality pictures for the most part. Many of the old ones are now being redone for this reason if no other. Some of the really old ones are only available in fiche scans so far, which are always too dark and often very blurry. That's an issue with the source material, not the scanning process.\n     The other issue with old scans is the difference between modern and old comics printing and paper, and the skill required of scanners as a result. Comics for decades were printed on less white paper than today. This helped keep them cheaper btw, I don't know how much difference that would make today. This requires differences in how they are scanned and edited for best results.  A greater reason for the editing differences is the paper has yellowed with the years. This may seem like another source material issue, and that's true. But we can hope for no-fiche sources (slowly happening), but we will never see un-yellowed paper sources.\n     Scanners rightly wish to adjust the color to offset the yellowing, but many don't know how. This is art restoration. It can be a tricky and painstaking business. The same adjustments will not work at all well on every page, or even parts of a page if this were to be done to professional standards. That's unreasonable to ask of volunteer scanners, but they do need to recognize the need not to over-whiten. Changing the color until the bare paper is white like today gives very unsatisfactory results. I keep those only if they are the only c-to-c scans available, and then keep an alternate. The coloring and printing process were quite different as well. In the past the artwork was all by hand, no computers. The colorists or sometimes printers (good ones) actually choose colors that might be of a slightly different color than otherwise to adjust for the paper color. This too can matter in restoration.\n\tSome scanners do an amazing job on old paper while others would be better of leaving the color alone. There are other big editing or scanning errors you see but most are not limited to old comics. And again thank you scanners for every blessed scan. Without you I would have no hope of reading the Gold &amp; Silver age comics I love. Even if I had the money, the oldest ones are fragile, and most people would fear to destroy their value by handling.\n\tWow that's too long, but editing it to shorter would take way more time than it's worth.\n\n\n\nToday's offering: DC from Ga-Giq\n\n     We have a fair amount of Pre-DC Wildstorm Comics in this group, from when they were part of Image. Some may appear to be &quot;pure&quot; Image, but Image was created as a partnership of creator owned units, so there was really no such thing as Image-in-itself when WS was a part of it. If you look closely you you will either find a WS logo somewhere on it, or sometimes you have to look in the copywrite text and see it is from &quot;Wildstorm Studios&quot;. Image was a brand name to provide a unified front. Later on the Wildstorm brand was put on the front cover. Wildstorm also had two imprints, Homage, and Cliffhanger so along the way in this series you will find comics with those names from Image, but not necessarily in this set.\n\tWe also have the Quality published issues of G.I. Combat before DC took it over.\n\n\nEnjoy! \n\nGALS! v1-10 (CMX, part Angel Comics-scanlated\nGammarauders 01-10 (1989)\nGang Busters 01-67 (1947-1959)\nGangland 01-04 (Vertigo(1998 )\nGarrison 01-05 (2010)\nGears of War 01-xx (WS-DC(2008-20xx)\n2 Gears of War Game Books\n    Gears of War Official Guide (Limited Edition).pdf\n    Octavirate Presents 001-The Gears of War.pdf\nGears of War Reader-covers only (WS-DC(2009)\nGears of War Sourcebook ctc (WS-DC(2009)\nSample Gears of War Novel - Gears of War 003-Anvil Gate-Karen Traviss.epub\nGemini Blood 01-09 (Helix(1996-1997)\nGen-Active 01-06 (WS(2000-2001)\nGen12 01-05 (Image-WS(1998 )\nGen13 (Wildstorm-Image\n    Gen13 3D Special 001 ctc 2 covers (1997)\n    Gen13 Annual 001 (1997)\n    Gen13 Bikini Pin-up Special 001 (06-1997)\n    Gen13 Bootleg 01-20 (1996-1998 )\n    Gen13 Bootleg Annual 001 (02-1998 )\n    Gen13 European Vacation Collection (08-1997)\n    Gen13-Bootleg 021 Solicitation.txt\n    Gen13-Bootleg 022 Solicitation.txt\n    Gen13 Interactive 01-03 (1997)\n    Gen13 Preview (10-1997)\n    Gen13 Rave (1995)\n    Gen13 Yearbook 001 (06-1997)\n    Gen13 Zine 001 (12-1996)\n    Gen13 v1 1/2 ,01-05 (1994)\n    Gen13 v2 00-36 (1994-1998 )\n    Gen13-Generation X (1997)\n    Gen13-Lost In Paradise TPB (1996)\n    Gen13-Magical Drama Queen Roxy 01-03 (1998 )\n    Gen13-Monkey Man &amp; O'Brien 01-02 (1998 )\n    Gen13-Ordinary Heroes 01-02 (1996)\n    Gen13-Rave (03-1995)\n    Gen13-The Maxx (12-1995)\n    Gen13-The Unreal World (07-1996)\n    Spiderman-Gen13 (1996)\n\nGen13 (Wildstorm-DC\n    Gen13 v2 37-77 after Image 36 (1999-2002)\n    Gen13 v2 Annual 1999-2000\n    Gen13 v3 00-16 (2002-2004)\n    Gen13 v4 01-39 (2006-2011)\n    Gen13 v4 covers\n    Gen13-A Christmas Caper (2000)\n    Gen13-Armageddon 001 (2008 )\n    Gen13-Carny Folk (02-2000)\n    Gen13-Going West (06-1999)\n    Gen13-Grunge Saves the World (1999)\n    Gen13-Medicine Song (2001)\n    Gen13-Science Friction (2001)\n    Gen13-Wired (04-1999)\nGeneral Mills Giveaway-Batman (1979)\nGeneral Mills Giveaway-Batman (1980)\nGeneral Mills Giveaway-Super Heroes (1979\nGeneral Mills Giveaway-Superman (1979)\nGeneral Mills Giveaway-Wonder Woman (1979)\nGeneration Hex (Amalgam(06-1997)\n          Generation Zero TPB is not scanned, but it's from this series below, so here's that as a substitute.\nGeneration Zero, The Complete-Epic Illustrated-DCP Archive Edition\nGenesis 01-04 (10-1997)\nGenesis Preview (1997)\nGenesis, The Complete v1-v3 (DCP Archives\nGeorge A.
