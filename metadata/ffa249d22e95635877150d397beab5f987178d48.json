The source for this belief is apparently a 1970 Rolling Stone artucle written during the recording of the album. However according to numerous posts on the Smiley Smile forum icluding posts made by sound engineer Stephen W. Desper himself, this is wrong. The entire album is &quot;matrix encoded&quot;. Stephen W. Desper has even been selling a 3D spatializer hardware device to be used with Surf's Up and (all of) Sunflower that converts the matrix encoding into some kind of virtual surround for playback on regular stereo systems.\n\nPlaying the album through the QS-D1000 all tracks decode nicely. I can hear no difference between the two songs mentioned above and the rest of the album.\n \n \n&quot;If you can feature the great candy-stripes grown up, then this is far more satisfying, I suspect, than Smile ever would have been. The medium-honest sensibility is a little more personal now, soulful in its Waspy way. Maybe they weren't really surfers or hot rodders, but they were really Southern Californians, and that's what their music was about. It still is, too, only now they sing about water, broken marriages, and the love of life. Still a lot of fun, too.&quot; A-\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa249d22e95635877150d397beab5f987178d48","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+Sunflower+%281970+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa249d22e95635877150d397beab5f987178d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,162,73,210,46,149,99,88,119,21,13,57,123,234,181,249,135,23,141,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
