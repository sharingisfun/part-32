But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basically about the nature of sin and the nature of the divine, which is the dual nature we have as Christians. Everyday we have to strive to throw away the old and be that new person in Christ.&quot;\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment has recently been using Monster for most of its major products. The song is one of the tracks in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. It was the theme song of the WWE PPV Hell in a Cell.
