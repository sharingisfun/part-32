This gorgeous collection of cushion and quilt projects are all inspired by Jo Colwill's life on her Cornish farm. Learn how to sew with step-by-step instructions, detailed diagrams and clever tips and tricks. For most of the projects, patchwork is combined with applique and hand embroidery, and the sewing techniques are clearly described to help you to achieve professional results. There's a wide range of designs to suit everyone, whether you're a beginner looking for a quick and simple cushion project or an experienced quilter wanting more of a challenge. You can make the projects just as they are or modify the ideas to create your own individual style. The book also includes a full-size quilt pattern for the featured Advent Quilt design.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb542583e70adeb814eb6755f86e9d3a0c09b4c","amp;dn":"Pillows+%26amp%3B+Quilts%2C+20+Projects+to+Stitch%2C+Quilt+and+Sew+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb542583e70adeb814eb6755f86e9d3a0c09b4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,181,66,88,62,112,173,235,129,78,182,117,95,134,233,211,160,192,155,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
