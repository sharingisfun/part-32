By following a few essential steps you will significantly reduce the cost of\ntesting your finish eel board design.\nMatching the way a board is designed, this comprehensive book considers\ndesign-for-test requirements in a step-by-step fashion with explanations of why a\nfeature is needed and what the consequences of ignoring it might be.\nThe hook:\n3 presents design-for-test principles In a manner that matches the way a\nboard is designed\n3 provides checklists to assess the testability of each completed design\n3 includes a chapter on the important IEEE standard on boundary-scan\n(IEEE Std 1149.1)\n3 discusses how a development project should be managed so that a testable\ndesign is achieved\nThis book will be very valuable for engineers and managers involved wish electronic\nboard design. It will also be suitable for students in electrical and electronic\nengineering and related disciplines to support courses in test development and\ndesign-for-test.\nColin Maunder is a consultant in computer-aided testing at BT Laboratories, UK. He is\nwell known internationally for his courses on design-for-test and his work on IEEE\nStd 1149.1. He received a major IEEE Computer Society award for leading the\ndevelopment of this important new standard for design-for-test and is currently\nEmeritus Chair of the international working group that is enhancing and maintaining\nthe standard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf12358950100976dd27eef2192be866bb2758f","amp;dn":"The+Board+Designers+guide+to+testable+logic+Circuits.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf12358950100976dd27eef2192be866bb2758f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,241,35,88,149,1,0,151,109,210,126,239,33,146,190,134,107,178,117,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
