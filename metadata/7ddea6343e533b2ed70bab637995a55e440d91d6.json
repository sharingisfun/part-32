The original version of the song features R&amp;B/Pop singer Ciara. Violent viedo, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t try this at home.\n\n\nThe entire music video is shot under blue-screen to give off a radiant but monotone color set. The music video opens up viewing portraits of Enrique and Ciara, then an ironic switch showing the two arguing and pushing back and forth outside of the house. The two part ways, and the song begins with EnriqueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first verse. He sings as the video randomly shoots back to a scene where Ciara is up against a wall. The chorus enters as Enrique is shown throwing things off a counter and out of drawers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ddea6343e533b2ed70bab637995a55e440d91d6","amp;dn":"Enrique+Iglesias-feat+Ciara-Takin+Back+My+Love-CONVERT-DVDRiP-MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ddea6343e533b2ed70bab637995a55e440d91d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,222,166,52,62,83,59,46,215,11,171,99,121,149,165,94,68,13,145,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
