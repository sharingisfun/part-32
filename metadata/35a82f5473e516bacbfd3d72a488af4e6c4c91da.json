The capability to build reliable reservoir models in a collaborative environment also assists in increasing the ultimate recovery.\n\nRoxar appreciates that the biggest challenge the exploration and production industry faces is the industry wide skills shortage with maturing and more difficult to develop hydrocarbon assets.\n\nRoxarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Irap RMS breaks down the barriers between geoscientists and engineers, resulting in better decisions through a shared understanding of the reservoir. Integrated workflows deliver team productivity improvements whilst also capturing valuable knowledge about the reservoir.\n\nIrap RMS is the E&amp;P industries premier solution for integrated static and dynamic reservoir modelling. It comprises of a range of linked modules, each covering a specific stage of the complete reservoir characterization, development and production optimisation workflow.\n\nIntegrate Reservoir Knowledge\n\nBreaking down the traditional barriers between technical domains Irap RMS enables the building of a shared earth model. This ensures that the expertise and knowledge of the full team can used to build the most accurate reservoir model for planning and decision making.\n\nReduce Risk and Manage Uncertainty\n\nIrap RMS makes it easy to generate multiple scenarios for the analysis of uncertainty across both the static and dynamic reservoir model. The ability to easily quantify the risks helps optimise the field development planning process and technical decision making. This ultimately leads to an improved project return on investment.\n\nProduce Accurate Results Quickly\n\nWith field development decisions which cost tens of millions of dollars it is critical to ensure that decisions are being made on accurate, up to date models which honour as much of the field data as possible. Irap RMS leads the industry in the integration of different data into the reservoir model. Workflow tools also ensure that models can be updated immediately when new data becomes available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a82f5473e516bacbfd3d72a488af4e6c4c91da","amp;dn":"Irap+RMS+7.5+%2B+rus+lession","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a82f5473e516bacbfd3d72a488af4e6c4c91da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,168,47,84,115,229,22,186,203,253,61,114,164,136,175,78,108,76,145,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
