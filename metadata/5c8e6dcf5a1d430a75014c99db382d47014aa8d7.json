He&amp;#039;s an unlikely but traceable amalgamation of random pop culture explosions from the past few years--two parts Paulo Nutini, one part Kemal from Big Brother, a dash of Daphne &amp; Celeste, a barrel measure of Scissor Sisters, and another pinch of post-ironic dancing to Elton John at the Students&amp;#039; Union gone midnight. It&amp;#039;s no secret that the UK has a weakness for pretty-boy singer songwriters either--he fits in there too, in that he&amp;#039;s about to stick its index finger in the socket and pour it a drink.\n\nGive it 12 months and you might be taking out a restraining order--Mika will split opinion--but his quasi-soul falsetto is unbelievable, that much is immediately obvious. There are moments nearing syrupy Feeling-esque normalcy (take &quot;My Interpretation&quot;), but those aside it&amp;#039;s high camp insatiability all the way. There&amp;#039;s a hint of Freddie Mercury?s theatricality in the voice, and in &quot;Big Girl&quot; he&amp;#039;s even written a modern day &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;. &quot;Lollipop&quot; is Jake Shears leading the Jackson 5, &quot;Love Today&quot; is the missing link between the Bee Gees and Village People and &quot;Relax, Take It Easy&quot; is a chilled Pet Shop Boys in gold lamÃƒÂ©. Too cheesy to be a classic, perhaps, but this is just the brand of subversive eccentricity Robbie has failed miserably to achieve over his past few albums. --James Berry\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c8e6dcf5a1d430a75014c99db382d47014aa8d7","amp;dn":"MIKA+-+Life+in+Cartoon+Motion+FLAC+UK+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c8e6dcf5a1d430a75014c99db382d47014aa8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,142,109,207,90,29,67,10,117,1,76,153,219,56,45,71,1,74,168,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
