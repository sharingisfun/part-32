Was real sweet. This does have   \n a forgein watermark that pops up at the top of the screen every now    \n and again, this is a silent movie, therefore they do not speak, however\n signs and subtitles are in english. All we did was just rip the DVD-R  \n down, great quality and yes the movie is in black and white. May not   \n be everybody's cup of tea but this has won quite a few awards. Enjoy! \u0002\n                                                                        \n\n\n\n                                                                        \n                                 \n                                                      \n                                                       \n                                                          \n                                                 \n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                                      \n                                         \n                                                                        \n         To Our Friends &amp; To The Past, Present And Future Of p2p.       \n                                                                        \n            Massive Thanks To J &amp; Chelle: You Guys Know Why. \u0002          \n                                                                        \n            If You Have Anything That You Can Provide Us With:          \n                                                                        \n                                                 Come And Find Us...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e7453caa1df05f4f78819dffd3d63766818518","amp;dn":"The+Artist+%282011%29+DVDSCR+x264-BBnRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e7453caa1df05f4f78819dffd3d63766818518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,231,69,60,170,29,240,95,79,120,129,157,255,211,214,55,102,129,133,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
