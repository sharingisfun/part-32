It is a\nfoundation on which a set of information from any area of human inquiry can operate,\njust as software programs run on a computer operating system. However, as you may\nknow, a software program could be wonderfully useful, but is only as practical and useful\nas the operating system it runs on. Mind OSTM is the next generation of self-help, and it\nis simultaneously what some have called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“holy grailÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of psychology theory. It is the\nonly comprehensive Unification Theory and system, synthesized from all former schools\nof psychology theory and self-help. As such, it integrates only the best of the best of\nworks you have already read, and makes them work together at a higher level of\nusefulness to your life. It uses everyday language you know wellÃ¢â‚¬â€words like Ã¢â‚¬Å“stressÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“failureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“self-esteemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and it uses diagrams to economize on your crystal clear\nunderstanding. I want to start an epidemic of personal empowerment.
