This mini focuses on Laura looking for glimpses of her own humanity in between her rage and killing sprees. Her resentment and frustration at being such an efficient weapon is difficult to reconcile, since it is all she has really ever known. Can X-23 save her soul, or is she forever lost to the violence? And what happens when she comes face-to-face with her would-be genetic twin, Wolverine? This is a great follow-up to the initial origin story and really delves deep into the psyche of Laura Kinney and what makes her it. These digital copies are provided by Zone-Empire, massive thanks to them. As always, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2fac69c4ff8879b3d42ccaab3295fc39647b9e","amp;dn":"X-23+%28X23%29+Target+X+01-06+%282007%2C+Digital%2C+Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2fac69c4ff8879b3d42ccaab3295fc39647b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,47,172,105,196,255,136,121,179,212,44,202,171,50,149,252,57,100,123,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
