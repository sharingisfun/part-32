Along with work for such singing and DJ luminaries as Eek-A-Mouse, Ranking Joe, and Frankie Paul, Lawes helped shape the era-defining sounds of his crack house band the Roots Radics. The Radics would soon transcend the confines of Lawes' projects, though, and become one of the most sought after studio and touring bands during the dancehall years. Unfortunately, this fine collection of Lawes-produced Radics cuts comes as a tribute to the famed producer, who was murdered in 1999 on a London street. A great collection of fairly uncluttered and sunny dub sides from the master and his equally impressive cohorts. ~ Stephen Cook\n\nheavy rub a dub cuts inna dubwise style produced by mixing genius Bravo - all cuts were originally produced by legendary Rub A Dub producer Henry Junjo Lawes \n\nRecorded at Leggo's Recording Studio, Kingston, Jamaica.
