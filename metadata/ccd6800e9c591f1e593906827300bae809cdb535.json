Vlad is a dispossessed noble, and a patriot who fights the occupation forces of the Turks. The King of Hungary (Roger Daltry) becomes Vlad's ally and, with his support, Vlad and his men attack the occupying Turks and turncoat Romanian boyars, and seizes the throne of Wallachia.\n\nLidia discovers what Vlad does to the bodies of his enemies and she is horrified. When Lidia has a child, Vlad takes control of the boy, and banishes her to a nunnery. Then, Vlad's brother Radu arrives at the head of a large Turkish invasion force.\n\nThe narrative of the film is presented as evidence given at a hearing following Vlad's alignment with the Roman Catholic King of Hungary. At the end of the film, Vlad is excommunicated by the Romanian Orthodox Church shortly before being assassinated by Radu. As a result of his condemnation by the priests, Vlad is found to have risen from the grave and gained eternal worldly life as well as the ability to move around a room in an instant, implying that he has now become the very vampire for which his name is famous for.\n\n\n\n\n        Rudolf Martin\t ... \tVlad Dracula the Impaler\n\n\tJane March\t... \tLidia\n\n\tChristopher Brand\t... \tBruno\n\n\tPeter Weller\t... \tFather Stefan\n\n\tRoger Daltrey\t... \tKing Janos\n\n\tMichael Sutton\t... \tRadu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccd6800e9c591f1e593906827300bae809cdb535","amp;dn":"Dark+Prince+-+The+true+story+of+Dracula","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccd6800e9c591f1e593906827300bae809cdb535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,214,128,14,156,89,31,30,89,57,6,130,115,0,186,232,9,205,181,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
