The reigning world champion in single sculls rowing, Silken was told by doctors she might never row again. Twenty-seven days, five operations and countless hours of gruelling rehabilitation later, Silken was back in her shell, ready to pursue her Olympic dream. When the starterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pistol rang out on August 2, 1992, Silken made the greatest comeback in Canadian sports history, winning the bronze medal for Canada and capturing the hearts of a nation. Silken retired from rowing in 1999 with three Olympic medals and since then has continued to inspire, encouraging people to dream, live in the moment and embrace failure as a stepping stone to success.\n\nBut there was a massive obstacle in her path that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never really spoken about. Unsinkable will be her no-holds-barred memoir, revealing not only new insights into her Olympic success and extraordinary triumph over physical adversity, but also a much darker hidden story about the intense personal challenges of her past.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Have tested both file types out on Samsung Note and desktop PC. I used Calibre and Kindle for PC on the desktop, and Kindle, Aldiko and mobi+ Reader on the Samsung Note 10.1 that I use. All chapter and other links through the book are fully functional.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776331d3e66533421c3e4054643b8c511e5d204c","amp;dn":"Unsinkable+by+Silken+Laumann+epub+mobi+Non-fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776331d3e66533421c3e4054643b8c511e5d204c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,99,49,211,230,101,51,66,28,62,64,84,100,59,140,81,30,93,32,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
