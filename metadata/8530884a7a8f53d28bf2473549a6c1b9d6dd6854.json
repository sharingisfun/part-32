Nervous\n\nOne of the great under-recognized singer/songwriters of the late 1960s/early '70s, Paul Siebel made only two studio albums, and they're both contained here in their entirety (unlike a previous Siebel collection that was missing half of his second album). Siebel matches often-poetic lyricism with a fluid country-rock sound (guests include the Byrds' Clarence White and future Eagle Bernie Leadon), but what really brings it home is his trenchant vocal delivery, a keening Bob Dylan-meets-Bill Monroe high-lonesome wail that cuts straight to the heart of the song. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8530884a7a8f53d28bf2473549a6c1b9d6dd6854","amp;dn":"Paul+Siebel+-+Woodsmoke+And+Oranges+%26amp%3B+Jack-Knife+Gypsy+%5B2004","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8530884a7a8f53d28bf2473549a6c1b9d6dd6854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,48,136,74,122,143,83,210,139,242,71,53,73,166,193,185,214,221,104,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
