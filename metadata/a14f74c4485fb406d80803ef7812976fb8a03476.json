When Tory broke down in tears, Kip at last agreed to find a calmer way to express his frustration. Just weeks later, ToryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother, Vicky, says the surly relationship has not only gotten worse, the hostility has escalated, and her patience is running thin. She says both Tory and Kip refuse to seek help, and now there is a new bombshell that is making their home life virtually unbearable. What does Kip say is his biggest issue with his stepdaughter? And, will this family finally agree to accept help and repair whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s left of their relationship? Then, Joe, 34, became an instant father to two teenage daughters. One of the girls has run away, and the other feels that he treats her like a slave. Can they resolve their disputes and come together as a family?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a14f74c4485fb406d80803ef7812976fb8a03476","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2011.05.31.My.Teen.Cant.Stand.Her.Stepfather.HDTV.X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a14f74c4485fb406d80803ef7812976fb8a03476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,79,116,196,72,95,180,6,216,8,3,239,120,18,151,111,184,160,52,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
