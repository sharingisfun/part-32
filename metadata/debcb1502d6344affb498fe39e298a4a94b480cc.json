He was renowned for his unique wrestling moves (and finishing move The Thumb) and crazy on-stage characters he created for himself. On match days he would find a historic figure whose date of birth fell on that day and pretend to be them during the match and in interviews.\nIn 1971, he released an album bearing his stage name, &quot;Beauregarde&quot; featuring Greg Sage of the Wipers on guitar. Beauregarde enlisted Sage (then 17) after overhearing him playing guitar for a friend's band at Sound Productions studio in Portland\n\nTracks:\n\nside one:\nA1. I Got Something (3:07)\nA2.
