Deep, dark and brooding, Combustion's dose of atmospheric synths, driving rhythms and melancholic metal riffs, combine to create a spontaneous explosive reaction.\n\nFeaturing nine tracks with an exclusive bonus Quicktime video of Uring Saracom live, Combustion is a truly stunning and full power frontal assault of the seven senses. Dark Soho once again delivers to the dance floors a nerve-shattering album that literally tears apart the boundaries of the psychedelic trance genre.\n\nWith extensive releases on psytrance compilations on Alchemy, Sphere and Hom-mega Records, Dark Soho have a reputation for ecstatic and energetic live shows which stand out next to many other live trance acts with their ultra heavy guitar laden riffs and symphonic sound on stage.\n\nStyle: Psytrance\n\nReleased: Dez. 2002/49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f32263c5b99e769d95356ec1a55eb004b1b8a443","amp;dn":"Dark+Soho+-+Combustion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f32263c5b99e769d95356ec1a55eb004b1b8a443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,34,99,197,185,158,118,157,149,53,110,193,165,94,176,4,177,184,164,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
