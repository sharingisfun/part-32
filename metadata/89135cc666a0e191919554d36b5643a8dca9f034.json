In its current state, it is basically vanilla Slacko 5.7 with Xfce4panel. No apps from the original have been removed (yet). Please test it out and provide feedback and bug reports. I would consider this beta quality, as there are some minor issues with the Xfce panel that I still need to work out, but it is still very usable. \n\n Thank You to 01micko and everyone else who had a hand in the creation of Slacko 5.7 \n\n The &quot;JX&quot; just stands for Jwm + Xfce4panel. This is a temporary name. I have a hard time trying to figure out names for my pups. Any suggestions for this one would be appreciated. \n\n Download Link: jx_slacko5.7_v0.1.iso \n size:156MB \n md5sum: b44c9c8844983c1244d67ab393bb1e21 jx_slacko5.7_v0.1.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89135cc666a0e191919554d36b5643a8dca9f034","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_JX_Slacko-5.7_archive_19-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89135cc666a0e191919554d36b5643a8dca9f034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,19,92,198,102,160,225,145,145,149,84,211,107,86,67,168,220,169,240,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
