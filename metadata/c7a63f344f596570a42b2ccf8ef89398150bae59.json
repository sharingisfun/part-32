The bandÃ‚Â´s dark-flavoured, crushingly heavy and absolutely unique Death Metal had something in it that appealed to many Death Metal -fans all over the world, and it wasnÃ‚Â´t that big surprise that SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES was hailed a true classic Death Metal album over the course of time. Those of you who have heard it before certainly know what IÃ‚Â´m talking about. ItÃ‚Â´s not surprising to see DemigodÃ‚Â´s SLUMBER on many death headsÃ‚Â´ TOP 5 or 10 lists of all time; not to mention all those people who shamelessly consider it as the best Death Metal album released ever.\n\n\n\nSince its edition was probably 10,000 units or less (nobody seems to know the exact amount of the copies?), it became harder and harder to get as the years passed by, an original copy of it now goes easily up to between $40-$60 in places like eBay - not to mention Gemm where prices go even ridiculously higher sometimes. But if you are a serious die-hard fan, those prices wonÃ‚Â´t scare you off up to the mountains.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was just a matter of time before this jewel would be re-released - and thatÃ‚Â´s what Dave Rotten, one of the owners of the Spanish Xtreem Music (plus the vicious throat in his own Avulsed, too), did through his so-called Xtreem Cult Series. For this reissue Dave managed to include DemigodÃ‚Â´s semi-legendary 3-song UNHOLY DOMAIN demo as bonus, with a mutual agreement of the Demidudes. So this makes the whole thing a bit more special and worth having for those Demigod -fans who never succeeded in obtaining a proper quality copy of it for themselves back in the day. The whole thing has been re-mastered as well that at least has helped their demo songs sound better. Surely it has done the same for the albumÃ‚Â´s material, but I didnÃ‚Â´t pay that much attention to it. The thing is that it still surprises me every now and then they came up with this monstrously heavy and dark sounding Death Metal record almost 14 years ago and it has stood the test of time all the way up to this very millenium. It was DemigodÃ‚Â´s growler Esa LindÃƒÂ©n who was the soul, carrying force and a true innovator in the band back then; and without whom Demigod would probably neither ever existed nor this blood-curling Death Metal masterpiece would have ever recorded in the first place. Such furiously, but controlled storming numbers as &quot;As I Behold I Despise&quot;, &quot;Blood of the Perished&quot;, &quot;Towards the Shrouded Infinity&quot; and an epic and monumental sounding Death Metal tune &quot;Slumber of Sullen Eyes&quot;, all were the results of EsaÃ‚Â´s amazing song writing skills, so thereÃ‚Â´s no question about his extremely precious yet vital input for the DemigodÃ‚Â´s unique, well-recognized sound. Without hesitating to spit it out, Esa LindÃƒÂ©n was a musical genious as far as composing mind-sticking Death Metal songs were concerned. Those of you who disagree, I would say you havenÃ‚Â´t even heard DemigodÃ‚Â´s epic Death Metal masterpiece SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES then.\n\n\n\nAs for Ã‚Â´decorationÃ‚Â´ of this Death Metal cult release, IÃ‚Â´m glad the guys have also decided to stay somewhat loyal to the original artwork which they had on the original Ã‚Â´92 -album version; only some slight improvements and changes have been done for both front - and back covers - and I must say I like this new version a bit better as it looks more professional and is overall more eye-catching.\n\n\n\nTo cut this all down short, if you havenÃ‚Â´t ever heard Demigod, then hereÃ‚Â´s your golden chance for it. And if, for some strange reason you wonÃ‚Â´t pick this re-release of DemigodÃ‚Â´s classic debut album up for yourself, then you donÃ‚Â´t know what you are missing. SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES is a very necessary piece of every self-respected Death Metal -fanÃ‚Â´s collection.&quot; - Metal-Rules.com\n\nDemigod\n\nSlumber of Sullen Eyes - Original:(1992) Re-release:(2006)\n\n1.
