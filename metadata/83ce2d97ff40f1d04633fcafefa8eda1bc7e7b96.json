The gate width can\r\n  be reduced to 0 % to cut the sound completely or increased to\r\n  100 % to cut the gating completely.\r\n\r\n  â€¢ Stereo gate patterns with 16 steps or â€œlinkedâ€ gate patterns\r\n    with 32 steps.\r\n  â€¢ Tied gates with 2 different modes, FILL or STRETCH.\r\n  â€¢ Three adjustable gate shapes: gate, ramp and trapezoid.\r\n    Gate width variable from 0-100%; ramp variable from falling to\r\n    rising; trapezoid variable from gate to triangle.\r\n  â€¢ Swing -99% to +99%. Greater control resolution around zero.\r\n  â€¢ Thirteen rates, including bypass (for cutting the effect in and\r\n    out with one control).\r\n  â€¢ Mix.\r\n  â€¢ MIDI controller learn.\r\n  â€¢ â€œFreewheelâ€: gate pattern continues if host sequencer stops.\r\n  â€¢ Genuine 64-bit audio processing. SSE-enabled. Any sample rate.\r\n    New smoothing algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n  Minimum system requirements:\r\n  Windows 32/64 bit.\r\n  VST 2.4 host program, SSE-enabled CPU, Windows XP or newer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               [INSTALLATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n                1) Unrar\r\n                         \r\n                2) Install.\r\n                         \r\n               3) Use a very boring serial\r\n\r\n                4) Its advised to have the DAW blocked in firewall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                â€¢ Thats it!
