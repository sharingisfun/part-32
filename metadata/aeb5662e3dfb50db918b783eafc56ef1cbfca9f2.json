Scott Fitzgerald: An Analysis and Annotated Bibliography, to the final two decades of the twentieth century. It includes literature from the former countries of the USSR, Romania, India, and Canada, as well as countries that were covered in the first volume, such as Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. One of the major findings that emerges is that Fitzgerald's poetic prose is extremely difficult to translate, but new translations continue to appear.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb5662e3dfb50db918b783eafc56ef1cbfca9f2","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+The+Foreign+Critical+Reputation+of+F.+Scott+Fitzger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb5662e3dfb50db918b783eafc56ef1cbfca9f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,181,102,46,61,251,80,219,145,139,120,62,175,197,110,241,203,252,169,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
