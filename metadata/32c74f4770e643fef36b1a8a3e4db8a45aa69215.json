It's field trip day for the students of Ballard High, a school that educates the children of Washington, D.C.'s elite, top-of-their-industry CEOs, international diplomats, political power players, even the President's son. But when their bus is ambushed on a secluded rural road, the teenagers and their chaperones are taken, igniting a national crisis.\n\nNow, with some of the country's most powerful parents at the mercy of one vengeful mastermind, the question arises: How far would you go and what would you become to ensure your child's safe return? With so many parents and dignitaries put into play with nowhere to turn and no one to trust, the unthinkable grows from the select families at risk to an entire nation at stake.\n\nTrailer -\nAdditional Clips -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c74f4770e643fef36b1a8a3e4db8a45aa69215","amp;dn":"Crisis+S01E01-E06.Eng+srt+-Lindoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c74f4770e643fef36b1a8a3e4db8a45aa69215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,199,79,71,112,230,67,254,243,107,26,138,62,77,184,164,90,166,146,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
