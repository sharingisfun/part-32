Among the pathogens covered are specific bacteria, including Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., and Bacillus spp.; viruses, including noroviruses and enteroviruses; and parasites, including Cryptosporidium and seafood nematode worms. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Biotechnologyâ„¢ series format, each offering step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principles behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79eb6287fb6021c5bf2f9d26e667fd1a0e5bdd3a","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Biotechnology+21+-+Food-Borne+Pathogens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79eb6287fb6021c5bf2f9d26e667fd1a0e5bdd3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,235,98,135,251,96,33,197,191,47,157,38,230,103,253,26,14,91,221,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
