Aurora has travelled 3,000 miles trying to find food for herself and her cub, but after such an epic journey, will the cub still be alive?\n\n2)  The Whales Tale \nSteve Leonard follows grey whales as they make the longest migration on the planet - a staggering 12,000 miles. Although they travel slowly, the whales never stop and Steve finds it increasingly difficult to keep up. Harassed by killer whales, dodging fishing nets and great white sharks, can the mothers and calves survive this epic\n\n3)  Osprey Odyssey \nThe sun is shining as Steve Leonard sets off to travel with three young ospreys, &quot;Bunga,&quot; &quot;Tasha&quot; and &quot;Jaws,&quot; on their first ever 3,000 mile migration from North to South America, via Cuba. Within days man and birds are battling with a hurricane, one bird is dead and the others scattered. Things start to get really difficult. Will the remaining birds survive, and can Steve keep up?\n\n4)  Running with Wild Dogs \nLiving rough in the African wilderness, Steve Leonard is on the trail of Chesney, Punter and Jones - three wild dogs about to face the biggest challenge of their lives as they leave the safety of the pack and head out into the unknown. For these dogs success will mean finding a mate and starting a new pack, but failure will mean only one thing: death at the hands of their deadly enemies, lions. In the wilderness, it's a &quot;cat eats dog&quot; world. For Punter and Jones the lure of their home pack proves too strong, but Chesney takes the kids with him when he leaves and recruits some allies to help raise them.\n\n5)  Wild Goose Chase \nNothing on earth regularly flies as high as bar-headed geese - they are a natural phenomenon. By any normal criteria their annual migration, right over the top of the Himalayas, should kill them all. As Steve Leonard tries to follow two of them, &quot;Hillary&quot; and &quot;Tenzing&quot;, on their journey from mysterious Tibet to the jungles of Nepal, it very nearly kills him too. The geese prove far better at coping with high altitudes and lack of oxygen than Steve does.\n\n6)  On the Trail of the Caribou \nSteve Leonard struggles with the extreme winter in the Yukon as he attempts to migrate across Canada with a heavily-pregnant caribou. Hounded by wolves, chased by bears and enduring appalling weather, can she make it to safety to deliver her calf?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/321/elqj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/321/elqj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/2503/j44gd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/2503/j44gd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5552/0l6o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5552/0l6o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/3817/cyma.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/3817/cyma.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/967/xfy2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/967/xfy2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8448/rlk3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8448/rlk3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8822/37y5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8822/37y5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/7379/jdt7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/7379/jdt7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/8749/nvswa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/8749/nvswa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1849/0scm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1849/0scm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8343/tiip.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/8343/tiip.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/5130/pdkh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/5130/pdkh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5518343c3b1519667b65&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1505 Kbps\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: average: 685 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Thanks to &quot;llamabert&quot;\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m8b2/clips&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m8b2/clips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Leonard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Leonard&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcb005b69072332dafe6d54d87f1f3521bc9b38","amp;dn":"BBC+Incredible+Animal+Journeys+5of6+Wild+Goose+Chase+PDTV+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcb005b69072332dafe6d54d87f1f3521bc9b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,203,0,91,105,7,35,50,218,254,109,84,216,127,31,53,33,188,155,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
