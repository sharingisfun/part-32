Sill performing entirely solo, her saintly voice is escorted only by acoustic guitar or piano on a playlist culled wholly from her 1971 self-titled debut and 1972's Heart Food. Only an eager audience's response between tracks and Sill's own timid introductions of what lies next remind you that the album is live. Apologizing for her thick accent, she tells of hearing &quot;Lady-O&quot; on the radio as recorded by the Turtles, her dreams of space-age raptures turning up in &quot;Enchanted Sky Machines,&quot; and how &quot;Down Where the Valleys Are Low&quot; channels '50s R&amp;B into a &quot;religious love song.&quot; Then she utterly nails the diffident beauty so prevalent on her studio recordings, such as the meandering vocals of &quot;Jesus Was a Crossmaker&quot; and the nursery-rhyming &quot;Lamb Ran Away with the Crown.&quot; Sill's nearly five-minute interview with the BBC's Bob Harris is a bonus, and a haunting peek into a future cut far too short. --Scott Holter\n\nProduct Description\n\nNearly 30 years after her passing Judee Sill remains one of the most important and singular talents of the Laurel Canyon scene. Her two releases for David GeffenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Asylum (1971's Judee Sill and 1973's Heart Food) are critically celebrated masterpieces of orchestral folk. Her songs have been covered by artists as diverse as The Turtles and Will Oldham and her fans include Jim OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Rourke, Devendra Banhart, Graham Nash, Sleater-Kinney and more. This amazing collection of previously unreleased live recordings from the BBC archives features beautiful versions of some of her most well known songs including ''Jesus Was A Cross Maker,'' ''Lady-O,'' ''The Kiss'' and more. Recorded in 1972 and 1973 at the peak of her talent, the tracks on this collection are from solo performances featuring Sill on vocals, piano and guitar. Absolutely stunning.\n\n\n\nTwo important reasons for buying this recording, and you don't have to be a hardcore fan: the fact that while a bit nervous, she also seems incredibly gentle, sweet, direct -painfully honest in the Jesus Was A Crossmaker introduction- and even funny when presenting her songs. This gives me a more realistic and less scandalous image of Judee, because it's been so widely publicized how troubled she was. Listening to her joking and connecting so vividly with her audience gives you a bigger picture of a complex woman. The public seems so warm and perceptive, too. A second reason: it's a real delight to hear her live because Judee had such high standards regarding her musicianship, lyricism and vocal delivery: not a single false nor exaggerated note, all songs performed with total belief and devotion. Her playing sounds as meticulous as if this were a studio session, and fortunately, the recording has very good quality. Reviewer Brian Greene isn't exaggerating when he says &quot;it seems these songs meant the world to her&quot;. She crafted and performed them so carefully, patiently (it took her one year to perfection &quot;Crossmaker&quot;) and lovingly that pretty much every recording out there of JS is worth having, really. Her albums have the most special place in my music collection. Up there with Pink Moon, Five Leaves Left, Pet Sounds, Rubber Soul...\n\n[Amazon user]\n\n\n\nTrack List :\n\n\n01.
