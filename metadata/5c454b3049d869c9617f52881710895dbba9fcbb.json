Says Tommy.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 11.23.2013\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription :\n\n\nThis week on Car Talk,\n\n     Tommy's life-long aversion to work meets its match in the U.S. Army,\n  \n       and his old pal Sgt. McNeely.\n\n        But, little did Tommy know that his ill-fated attempt to avoid target practice\n         would one day become official government policy in the U.K.\n\n In matters automotive, Alex loves his truck so much,\n    he refers to its oil type as &quot;Type O-Negative,&quot;\n      but it may be time for it to meet its crusher;\n\n   Fran can't decide whether to let her teenage daughter drive Grandpa's old Town Car,\n      affectionately known as &quot;The Party Barge&quot;;\n\n   and Tom and Ray try a new exit strategy for difficult questions: \n     Diagnosis by Hypnosis. \n\n\n  All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk.
