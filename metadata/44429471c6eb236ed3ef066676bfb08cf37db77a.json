He will deconstruct former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski's acclamation that a Ã¢â‚¬Å“resistanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ movement is impeding the march towards a New World Order and Rand Paul's calls for amnesty, and will also offer a diagnosis of the prevailing brutish police thug-culture and gang-like mentality increasingly acclimating the public into submissive fear.\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44429471c6eb236ed3ef066676bfb08cf37db77a","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+Nov+26+MO+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44429471c6eb236ed3ef066676bfb08cf37db77a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,66,148,113,198,235,35,110,211,239,6,102,118,191,176,140,243,125,183,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
