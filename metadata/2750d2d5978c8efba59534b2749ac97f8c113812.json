Inheriting the duties of his late father, Peter hasn't maintained the same level of quality or success. He doesn't have the drive, wisdom, or expertise to produce something of worth, even by the relaxed standards of its 3 A.M. timeslot.  \nA network executive (Jeff Garlin, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;) calls in Peter to tell him the end is nigh for the drivel-laden show. But until the plug is pulled and the network hires a more resourceful competitor (Harry Hamlin), there is still hope. \n\n\n\n\n\nCodec..........: H.264\nResolution.....: 1920x1080\nBitrate........: 5.2 Mbps\nFramerate......: 24fps\nAudio..........: AC3 Dolby Digital 5.1CH Surround (640Kbs)\nSubtitles......: None\nExtension......: M2TS\n\n\nPlease if you like the movie PLEASE SEED it so others can enjoy it to.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2750d2d5978c8efba59534b2749ac97f8c113812","amp;dn":"Strange.Wilderness.1080p.AC3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.ps3.Bricktop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2750d2d5978c8efba59534b2749ac97f8c113812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,80,210,213,151,140,142,251,165,149,52,178,116,154,201,127,140,17,56,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
