Established in 1864, the operetta &quot;The Beautiful Helen&quot; in an ironic tone and juicy details tells the story of the fatal love prince of Paris to the daughter of Zeus and Leda - beauty Elena, the wife of King Menelaus. As you know, stealing Helen, Paris started the Trojan War. But the saga of the Great War are least interested in Offenbach and librettists, in a play which the gods and kings have become parodies of images: fools, slackers, sensualist and gluttons, and only the love theme has been widely developed in the beautiful arias, duets, ensembles, requiring virtuoso performers of ownership vocal skills. Thanks to the production of &quot;Beautiful Helena&quot; genre of operetta established on the Russian stage. She gained such wide popularity that her music could be heard even in music boxes. So, Chekhov in August 1883 Leikin wrote: &quot;... Someone has got the box, and I hear,&quot; Helen of Troy &quot;...&quot;. Perhaps for the first time this operetta Chekhov heard in his youth, as it was part of the repertoire of the Taganrog Theatre, haunted future writer. During the performance, the audience roar with laughter, haunting light graceful melodies, and then joined in singing favorite arias.
