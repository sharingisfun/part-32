Zander Cannon launches HECK (the story of a washed-up high school football hero who discovers a portal to the underworld), while Kevin Cannon presents CRATER XV (following the smash success of his first graphic novel FAR ARDEN with an all-new saga of that crusty Arctic sea-dog Army Shanks). In a world of thin plotting, price-gouging, and trade-waiting, two cartoonists are here to fly the flag for two-fisted action and page-turning thrills!
