I'm not sure what else to say except to MAKE SURE YOU SEED PLEASE.\n\nI'll let you know upfront that I cannot seed every minute of every day.  So please be patient for this to get out there and please don't just hit and run this torrent.  This is IMPOSSIBLE to find and took many hours of capturing streaming video (I'm new at this and it took a LONG time to get it right).\n\nEpsidoes are:\n\n1.  Communication\n2.  Energy\n3.  Engineering and Architecture\n4.  Exploration from Sea to Space\n5.  Math, Business, and Industry\n6.  Scientific Advancements in our Homes\n7.  The Science of Materials\n8.
