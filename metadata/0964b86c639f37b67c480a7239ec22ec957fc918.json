('STRANGEWIND')\n\nQuality: 8\n\nLineage: AUD (trade) &gt; WAV (EAC) &gt; FLAC (TLH 2.2.2 - 152) \n\n\nSONIC HAWK shares...\n\nI delayed posting this on Dime because originally I thought it was a soundboard recording. However, after some consultation I'm now satisfied it's an AUD recording, albeit a fairly good one. Some audience sound intrudes in places but not too severely.\n\nSTRANGEWIND:\n\nOnly one gig all year, and Dave Brock and Ron Tree missed it through being denied entry to the USA. There's a detailed account of the behind-the-scenes problems at http://www.strange-trips.com/docs/sd98.htm and how a couple of Cleveland Hawkwind fans were asked to step in and fill the gaps at the last minute! \n\n\nLINE-UP:\n\nJerry Richards: lead guitar, synths, vocals\nSteve Taylor: bass (Ohio guy drafted in)\nRichard Chadwick: drums, percussion \nCapt. Rizz: noisemaker, vocals\nSteve Hayes: keyboards (Ohio guy drafted in)\n\nTHE SHOW:\n\nBlanga content pretty high, and spacey sound fx, once things get going. Most unusually, there's 10 mins of preamble before the first number proper - echoes of 1971 there! 'Starfire' is about the festival area and the main Rizz vocal is 'It's all because of you' or variations of that. It's an embryonic form of the Hawkwind song 'Hippy', I'm told.\n\n'Space is Deep' is weird, a perky 80's reggae organ riff with the vocals as a narrative. Reggae also pops up in 'In Your Area': Jump up and down, swing yourselves around!\n\nSET:\n\n01 ten-minute intro: announcements / control your own minds\n02 Wheels\n03 Standing On The Edge\n04 Assault And Battery\n05 Golden Void\n06 Spirit Of The Age\n07 Starfire Mountain Dreaming [Hippy]\n08 Time We Left\n09 Space is Deep\n10 Brainstorm - In Your Area [Camera] - Brainstorm\n\nNote: Starfarer's page shows a swathe of tracks after Brainstorm but accounts of the show that I've read indicate that what's in this torrent is the full show.\n\n72 mins.\n\nARTWORK:\n\nThanx to Liverpool's Richie for the alternative cover art. Yep, definitely innocent, lol","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0964b86c639f37b67c480a7239ec22ec957fc918","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+1998-07-15+Strange+Daze%2C+Nelson+OH+%28%5C%27Strangewind%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0964b86c639f37b67c480a7239ec22ec957fc918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,100,184,108,99,159,55,182,124,72,10,114,57,236,34,236,149,127,201,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
