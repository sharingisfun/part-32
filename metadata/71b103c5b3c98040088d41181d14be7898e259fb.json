It is available in a free version, which scans for and removes malware when started manually, and a paid version, which additionally provides scheduled scans, real-time protection and a flash memory scanner.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/nKDiW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ultraimg.com/images/nKDiW.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPC World's Preston Gralla wrote that &quot;Using Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware is simplicity itself&quot;.[4]\nFilesGang.com gives Malwarebytes Anti-Malware solution a 3.5 out of 5 stars rating, naming it the antivirus software that managed to remove the threat created by a rogue anti-virus software that infected a very large number of PCs and caused huge financial losses.[8]\nCNET in 2008 cited Malwarebytes as being useful against the MS Antivirus malware,[9] and also awarded it an April 2009 Editor's Choice, along with 25 other computer applications.[7][10]\nMark Gibbs of Network World gave Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware 4 stars out of 5 in January 2009 and wrote that &quot;It does the job and only the lack of a detailed explanation of what it has found stops it from getting 5 out of 5&quot;.[11]\nPC Magazine gave Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware 3.5 stars out of 5 in May 2010, saying that although it was good at removing malware and scareware, it fell short on removing keyloggers and rootkits.[12] However, the free version got 4.5 stars out of 5Ã¢â‚¬â€and an Editor's Choice awardÃ¢â‚¬â€for free removal-only antivirus software in 2013-4.[13]\nThe usefulness of Malwarebytes Enterprise Edition has been questioned, on the basis that it is particularly good at removing, rather than detecting malware, but adds expense and complexity, and consumes computer resources and reduces performance. For the enterprise, malware removal is usually unimportant, as an infected machine is typically re-imaged from a standard desktop image, discarding the infected system.[14]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71b103c5b3c98040088d41181d14be7898e259fb","amp;dn":"Malwarebytes+Anti-Malware+Premium+For+Ever%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71b103c5b3c98040088d41181d14be7898e259fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,177,3,197,179,201,128,64,8,141,65,24,29,20,190,120,152,226,89,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
