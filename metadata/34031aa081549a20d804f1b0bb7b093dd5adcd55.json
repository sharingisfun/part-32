Although the vibe is quite laid back (the band might be hungover), it's a very well played show, and includes some dynamite jamming. Jerry's guitar sounds amazing in the mix. You can hear every line, and he's rippin it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34031aa081549a20d804f1b0bb7b093dd5adcd55","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1971-02-20+-+Capitol+Theater+in+Port+Chester%2C+NY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34031aa081549a20d804f1b0bb7b093dd5adcd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,3,26,160,129,84,154,32,216,4,241,176,187,123,9,61,213,173,205,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
