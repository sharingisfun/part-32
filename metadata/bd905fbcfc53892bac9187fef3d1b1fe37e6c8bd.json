Players will know that Dangerous Seed re-uses various tracks during the course of the game (particularly during Stage 8). For simplicity, I've split the stages and boss themes as the tracklist below denotes.\n\nThis collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate audio from any other Dangerous Seed music CD (there was one, apparently, surely incredibly rare outside Japan), or Simon B's previous posting of this soundtrack on FFShrine.\n\nProps to Mushaaleste on Youtube for his longplay, without which it would have been rather more difficult to correctly place each track to their respective stages and bosses.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www21.atwiki.jp/gamemusicbest100/pages/399.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www21.atwiki.jp/gamemusicbest100/pages/399.html&lt;/a&gt; was also helpful.  For the record, Project2162 have a mostly inaccurate tracklist for this game, as of publishing this soundtrack (February 2012).\n\n---------------\n\n\nDangerous Seed Soundtrack (Original Sound Version)\n\nFoobar VGM HQ WAV dumps; post-processing/mastering by Vertiphon\n\nComposed by Yosiquin, Neumann A.H, Shimokyara, Totsukurzwell (aka NAUN)\nCopyright 1990 Namcot\nVertiphon 2012 remaster\n\n\n01 Departure  0:17\n02 Stage Introduction  1:52\n03 First Tube + Target Planet (Stages 1 + 8)  1:51\n04 Second Tube + Mars (Stages 2 + 5)  1:18\n05 Third Tube + Uranus (Stages 3 + 7)  1:27\n06 Fourth Tube (Stage 4)  1:06\n07 Jupiter + In Danger Seed Part 2 (Stages 6 + 10)\n08 In Danger Seed Part 3 (Stage 11)  1:49\n09 In Danger Seed Part 4 (Stage 12)  1:18\n10 Triple Eye + In Danger Seed Part 1 (Boss 1 + Stage 9)  1:20\n11 Strike Ant + Strike Mantis (Bosses 2 + 10)  0:55\n12 Roller Snail + Hunter Snail (Bosses 3 + 11)  1:27\n13 Hunter Moth + Twin Claw (Bosses 4 + 7)  1:06\n14 Multi Squid + Danger Seed (Boss 5 + 8)  1:04\n15 Shark Mouth + Ultimate Tiger (Bosses 6 + 9)  0:53\n16 Brain Of Danger (Final Boss)  1:20\n17 Ending Theme  1:33\n18 Countdown  0:46\n19 Game Over  0:07\n\n\n\nThe files are in 24-bit 44.1 kHz FLAC audio format.\n\nThis soundtrack has been created with gapless play in mind.\nDo not add gaps if you burn to a CD as audio.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd905fbcfc53892bac9187fef3d1b1fe37e6c8bd","amp;dn":"Dangerous+Seed+Vertiphon+Remaster+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd905fbcfc53892bac9187fef3d1b1fe37e6c8bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,144,95,188,252,83,137,43,172,145,135,254,243,209,177,254,55,230,200,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
