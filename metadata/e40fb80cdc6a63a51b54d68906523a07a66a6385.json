The Harvest Floor will undoubtedly be a milestone in the ever-diversifying metal scene that is now dominating the globe. The album shows a return to the engineering and production skills of Billy Anderson (Mr. Bungle, Melvins, Swans) with a combination of drum recording by Zach Ohren (All Shall Perish, Decrepit Birth) to create a modern but unique sound that is disturbingly pummeling. Holed up in Sharkbite studios in Oakland, CA for nearly a month away from the punishing light of day, the band hid in the depths and have sprouted new hell with the masterpiece that is The Harvest Floor.\n\n1.
