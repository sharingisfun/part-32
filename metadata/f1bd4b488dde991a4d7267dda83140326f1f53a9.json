Best evidence has them forming sometime in the late 1960s in Poughkeepsie, New York, by guitarists Larry LaFALCE and Dino PAOLILLO. The duo was soon joined by Geno CHARLES(drums), Frankie PREVITE(vocals,recorder,percussion), Ron PICCOLO(keyboards) and Lenny VENDITTI(bass). LaFalce and Venditti were formerly with NY bands The PYRAMID, Previte had been with The OXFORD WATCHBAND, and Piccolo a member of The REVELLS. With Vinny Testa producing, the group released a self-titled debut in 1971 on Mercury Records but poor marketing and sales meant that the band only issued one more album, 1972's 'Free For All', before BULL ANGUS split up (although PREVITE will forever be a footnote in pop history for penning &quot;The Time of My Life&quot; for the Dirty Dancing soundtrack!).\n\nIt is odd that BA didn't make a larger impact at the time; their brand of post-psychedelic heavy blues successfully crossed between jam-happy Southern rock and budding Prog. The material was often compared to heavyweights like URIAH HEEP and ATOMIC ROOSTER as well as homegrown GRAND FUNK RAILROAD, but the band's dexterity and large roster meant they could occasionally leave hardrock behind and dabble in early Crimson-style folk. Despite all this, Bull Angus never earned a cult following and has remained underappreciated to this day.\n\n- The Whistler -\n\n--------------------------------------\nReview by migue091\n4 stars Quite solid album this one I have come to quite accidentally. You will find here the highlights that made great bands like Rooster, Heep, Purple or even Lynyrd Skynyrd, such mix is thrown in these pieces of music.\n\nMaybe this band did not have the recognition I think they should have had because there's not a single track that really stands out over the rest (maybe CY sets a different mood for its acoustic nature (great tune by the way!)), so due to low commercial success they delivered just two albums\n\nHammonds and double guitars are present in all the album, delivered in an energetic way, with good interplay, riffing and crunchy soloing. The doble guitar attack and the flavour is sometimes more sabbat, zep or purple but sometimes they threw some souther flavours ala Lynyrd Skynyrd. Quite tasty mix, let me tell you. There's even some flute every now and then that really fits the themes. The songs are complex and dynamic enough to consider this prog in the same terms as, for example, Uriah Heep.\n\nSongwriting is ok, maybe not superb, but this is a very pleasant listen to everyone who loves heavy prog hammond and guitar driven.\n\nThere are also good vocal harmonies even in the backing vocals, and the lead singer reminds to Gillan or Byron, and is quite dynamic.\n\nAll in all, I'm having a really good time listening to this, and it is leaving me in a very good mood so...I'll give it a weak 4 stars, give them a try!\n\n----------------------\n\nReview by Sean Trane\nSpecial Collaborator Prog-Folk Specialist\n3 stars Almost four star, but not yet!!!\n\nAmerican sextet band (with four members ? id not all six - of Italian descendence) from the Midwest, who developed a hard-driving organ-lead prog rock a bit similar to what many English bands did in the early 70's. This is their debut album, which dates from 71 recorded in NYC and was released on the Mercury label with a big bullish gatefold artwork. This twin-guitar group with the singer playing flute and percussion and an ever-present keyboardist (who very modest songwriter in terms of credits) play an energetic rock somewhere between Purple, Heep and Rooster (Farlowe era), but the fact that they're six allows them more instrumental freedom, although I wouldn't say that there are major surprises either.\n\nEight tracks (4 aside) no longer than 7.5 minutes, but a fairly wide sonic spectrum, where the main songwriting guitar duo (6 co-credits each) dominates but not outrageously, leaving plenty of space for everyone to blossom out more or less freely, without affecting the tightness of the band's songs. If you can picture Previte's vocals as a cross of Gillan and Farlowe, Piccolo's organ (nope, not flute ;o))) sounding Crane-ian or Lord-esque, the twins stringers marrying Blackmore and DuCann. While all of the songs are catchy enough (sometimes with relatively fun lyrics), not one seems to stand out from the pack, except maybe the quieter Cy. The flute doesn't systematically intervene in all tracks and never grows to Tull-ian proportions, but when it does rear its spout, it's a real delight, bringing a real plus to the overall sonic scheme.\n\nWell if you love early-70's UK organ-driven hard prog, no doubt you'll love this first album, but I can't tell you if their second is as good, cos I've never seen it (let alone heard it), either in vinyl or in CD format. I gather that both vinyls are rather rare nowadays, and the fans had to wait a fair bit of time before both got a legit Cd reissue, but I bet that most are happy it happened just after the Millennium. In the meantime, this debut should satisfy your curiosity. While generally BA has their own personality, one can't help but feeling a bit awkward when some passages are a little too close for comfort to the other groups mentioned, but it's absolutely not interfering with the overall enjoyment of the album.\n\n\n\n========================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/bull_angus/bull_angus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/bull_angus/bull_angus/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRDTEN1:\nI'm not sure how to best describe this short-lived Poughkeepsie, New York-based outfit. With a line-up featuring drummer Geno Charles, twin lead guitarists Larry LaFalce and Dino Paolillo, keyboardist Ron Piccolo, lead singer Frankie Previte, and bassist Lenny Venditti they've always struck me as falling somewhere in the hard rock spectrum between an American version of Uriah Heep (also signed to Mercury at the time) and perhaps a less oppressive version of Deep Purple. I know those comparisons are going to send a bunch of folks scurrying for the next review, but the results were actually surprisingly impressing and enjoyable.\n\nThey apparently came together in the late-1960s with most of the members having paid their dues in various Hudson Valley, New York outfits such as The Oxford Watchband (Previte), The Pyramid (LaFalce and Venditti), and The Revells (Piccolo). The name came from a farm they rented as a rehearsal site in Rhinebeck, New York which was surrounded by nearby Angus farms. Club dates and extensive local touring caught the attention of Mercury which signed them resulting in the release of 1971's cleverly titled &quot;Bull Angus&quot;. Produced by Vinny Testa, the album featured a first-rate set of all-original hard rock. Largely written by the team of Previte, LaFalce, and Paolillo, nothing here was particularly original, or groundbreaking, but by the same token all ten tracks were uniformly strong and enjoyable. Previte had the perfect voice for the genre; capable of effortlessly shifting gears from metal growl, to higher register squeals in an instant. Also deserving credit were twin lead guitarists LaFalce and Paolillo. Speaking of which the liner notes included the following helpful information: &quot;stereo notes: Larry's the guitar on the left, Dino's on the right&quot;.\n\n- Opening up with 'Run Don't Stop' the album started with a blazing rocker that had all; pounding rhythm, killer melody, crushing guitars, and a nice vocal from Previte.\n- Kicked along by Piccolo's organ, and Previte's snarling vocals, 'Mother's Favorite Lover (Margaret)' always reminded me of Deep Purple - okay Previte's jazzy recorder solo wasn't a Deep Purple-ish trait. Great subject matter to boot; a mom with lesbian tendencies.\n- The subject matter's always been a mystery to me (though kind of ominous), but 'Uncle Duggie's Fun Bus Ride' sported a catchy melody, some killer lead guitar, and showcased the band's killer harmony vocals. Very nice.\n- In marked contrast to the rest of the album, 'A Time Like Ours' found the band pursuing a distinctive progressive direction. Mind you, propelled by some nifty twin lead guitar from LaFalce and Paolillo, it wasn't pompous ELP-styled prog, rather stood as one of the unexpected album highlights. The song was also interesting for showcasing the band's unexpectedly tight harmony vocals.\n- For some reason I've associated 'Miss Casey' with Spinal Tap. I'm assuming that the song wasn't meant to be humorous, but within the confines of this 7 and a half minute song the band somehow managed to cobble together all the elements that are now associated with hard rock song - screaming lead vocals, dumber-than-dirt, hyper sexist lyrics (&quot;you're my morning do&quot;), cart wailing organ, blazing twin lead guitars, Cro-Magnon bass, and multiple time changes. And I love it ...\n- Penned by LaFalce, 'Pot of Gold' was the most mainstream and commercial track. With a strong melody, a great lead guitar pattern, and some wonderful harmony vocals, this one would have made a dandy FM hit.\n- Coming as a totally unexpected surprise, the acoustic ballad 'Cy' showcased the band's 'sensitive' side. Beautiful song with fantastic acoustic guitars and it even included a but of scatting. Damn, wish I could play something half as good ...\n- Time to get heavy ... 'No Cream for the Maid' (hysterical title), found the band shifting their standard metal moves to incorporate some progressive moves. Such hybrids usually fall flat on their faces, but these guys were talented enough to pull it off resulting in one of the album's best tracks.\n\nElsewhere Mercury tapped the album for a single in the form of:\n\n- 1971's 'Run Don't Stop' b/w 'Uncle Duggie's Fun Bus Ride' (Mercury catalog number 73265)\n\nAs mentioned before, a really good and grossly overlooked early-1970s hard rock effort that truly sounded better when you cranked up the volume. Well worth owning, particularly since you can still score it on the cheap. Also, Dan Clyne's cover art was neat.\n\n\n&quot;Bull Angus&quot; track listing:\n(side 1)\n1.) Run Don't Stop (Frankie Previte - Larry La Falce - Dino Paolillo) - 4:23\n2.) Mother's Favorite Lover (Margaret) (Frankie Previte - Larry La Falce - Dino Paolillo) - 3:43\n3.) Uncle Duggie's Fun Bus Ride (Frankie Previte - Larry La Falce - Dino Paolillo) - 4:27\n4.) A Time Like Ours (Frankie Previte - Larry La Falce - Dino Paolillo) - 6:24\n\n(side 2)\n1.) Miss Casey (Frankie Previte - Lenny Venditti - Larry La Falce - Dino Paolillo) - 7:28\n2.) Pot of Gold (Larry La Falce) -3:51\n3.) Cy (Frankie Previte - Dino Paolillo) - 5:30\n4.) No Cream for the Maid (Frankie Previte - Lenny Venditti - Larry La Falce - Dino Paolillo) - 6:43\n\n\nclassicrockman:\nA fine, solid, musical hard rock LP. Fans of Deep Purple will be impressed. Good playing, singing and production. The twin guitars are very effective! As the last reviewer said - play this loud! - it does make a difference - it seems to have more punch!. Side 1 is faultless, the quality drops only slightly on side 2.\n\nHellBentForLager:\nA decade before hitting the charts with the early '80s AOR group Franke &amp; the Knockouts (&quot;Sweetheart&quot;), soulful singer Frankie Previte was fronting the upstate NY band Bull Angus, an unjustly overlooked six-piece hard rock group that released two solid albums on Mercury Records. Their 1971 self-titled debut is the heavier and better of the two, filled with jammy, slightly jazzy, progressive-tinged hard rock not unlike a mix of Uriah Heep, Grand Funk Railroad, and the harder tunes of Spirit. There's really not a bad cut on Bull Angus, but favorites include hard rockin' single &quot;Run Don't Stop&quot;, the far-out &quot;Uncle Duggie's Fun Bus Ride&quot;, &quot;Miss Casey&quot;, and the cleverly-titled closer &quot;No Cream for the Maid&quot;. Produced by Vinny Testa, with stereo separation for the band's two guitarists, the record's unipack gatefold artwork is quite cool as well.\n\n\n\n========================================================================\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBull Angus - Bull Angus\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Bull Angus\nAlbum................: Bull Angus\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1971\nRipper...............: Exact Audio Copy (Secure mode) &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: FLAC\n\nRipped by............: cozzmick on 4/26/2011\nPosted by............: cozzmick on 5/10/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO, MD5, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers...............: Front Back CD\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
