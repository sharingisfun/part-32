Woolfson (Author)\n\nPublisher: World Scientific Publishing Company; 2nd Edition | ISBN: 1848169337 | 2013 | PDF | 496 pages | 9 MB\n\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Time-Space-Stars-Man-Story/dp/1848162723&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Time-Space-Stars-Man-Story/dp/1848162723&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBook Description:\n\n\nThe three greatest scientific mysteries, which remain poorly understood, are the origin of the universe, the origin of life and the development of consciousness. This book describes the processes preceding the Big Bang, the creation of matter, the concentration of that matter into stars and planets, the development of simple life forms and the theory of evolution that has given higher life forms, including mankind.\n\nThere are many popular and excellent science books that present various aspects of science. However, this book follows a narrow scientific pathway from the Big Bang to mankind, and depicts the causal relationship between each step and the next. The science covered will be enough to satisfy most readers.\n\nMany important areas of science are dealt with, and these include cosmology, particle physics, atomic physics, galaxy and star formation, planet formation and aspects of evolution. The necessary science is described in a narrative form that general-interest readers should understand, without the use of equations or formulae.\n\nThis 2nd edition includes several updates on the subjects that form the pillars of this book. They are: cosmology and astronomy, the features and formation of the solar system, the origin of life, and genetics and evolution. This book will appeal to readers with an interest in biology and those curious about the origins of the universe.\n \n           \n              Support the Editors &amp; Buy the Book If you Like it \n\n\nScreen:\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAMAaaAeN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/hAMAaaAeN&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n            --As Eternity has reckoned There's a lifetime in a second--\n\n\nNOTE:\n*Seed as long you can(1:1 ratio is appreciated)\n*If you don't like what you see then don't download.Simple\n*Don't hit and run.Most of these torrents will not be greater than 100MB in size\n*Quality will be top notch regardless of file size be it Videos or Pictures\n*Any torrent which needs seeding kindly comment in that section\n*Visit my uploads @     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Orion_Me/&lt;/a&gt;      &amp; \n*Comments are always welcome\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nVisit my Thread of Daily Update Uploads:\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=148365&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270fd973f512ed390364b2bd8421d529ea670554","amp;dn":"Time%2CSpace%2CStars+and+Man%3AThe+Story+of+the+Big+Bang+Illustrated+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270fd973f512ed390364b2bd8421d529ea670554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,15,217,115,245,18,237,57,3,100,178,189,132,33,213,41,234,103,5,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
