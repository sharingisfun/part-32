This interesting set collects singles and alternate takes that Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers recorded for Clement Dodd at Dodd's Studio One between 1964 and 1966, and they show the Wailers moving through ska into a kind of proto-rocksteady stance. The master tapes for these sessions have long since vanished, so everything here is transferred from near-mint condition period singles that Dodd released on his various imprints, which included Coxsone, Studio One, Supreme, Tabernacle, and Wincox. the Wailers were very much a group at this time, and it wasn't quite the Bob Marley show yet (that wouldn't really happen until Island stepped in almost a decade later), and the heavy influence of American R&amp;B vocal groups is readily apparent, particularly that of Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. Highlights here include the title track, Mayfield's &quot;Another Dance&quot; (featuring a fine tenor sax break by Roland Alphonse); an early ska version of &quot;One Love&quot; (Marley re-recorded the song for 1977's Exodus album and that version has been used by the Jamaican Tourist Board ever since in promo spots); the gorgeous &quot;It Hurts to Be Alone,&quot; which spotlights the singing talents of early Wailers member Junior Braithwaite (not to mention the jazz guitar figures of Ernest Ranglin); and the tent revival-tinged &quot;I Left My Sins,&quot; originally issued by Dodd on his gospel imprint, Tabernacle. More archival and historical in intent than commercial, this set weaves its own magic and spotlights a time when the Wailers were actually the Wailers and not just Bob Marley's backup band.\n\n\nGenre................: Reggae / Ska\nSource...............: CD {Heartbeat 11661-7835-2}\nYear.................: 2007\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Log, Cue, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Another Dance\n02.I'm Still Waiting\n03.Ska Jerk\n04.Playboy\n05.Love Won't Be Mine\n06.Don't Ever Leave Me\n07.Straight And Narrow Way\n08.Lonesome Feelings\n09.Cry To Me\n10.One Love\n11.Somewhere To Lay My Head\n12.It Hurts To Be Alone\n13.Where Will I Find\n14.Lonesome Track\n15.Let Him Go\n16.Love And Affection\n17.Guajara Ska\n18.I Left My Sins\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8d474d2c3b27977aa6f6cd52c1fe49241bc870","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+%26amp%3B+The+Wailers+-+Another+Dance+Rarities+2007+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8d474d2c3b27977aa6f6cd52c1fe49241bc870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,141,71,77,44,59,39,151,122,166,246,205,82,193,254,73,36,27,200,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
