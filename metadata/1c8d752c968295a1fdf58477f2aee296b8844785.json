Cold-blooded murder just isn't Thomas Lang's cup of tea. Offered a bundle to assassinate an American industrialist, he opts to warn the intended victim instead -- a good deed that soon takes a bad turn. Quicker than he can down a shot of his favorite whiskey, Lang is bashing heads with a Buddha statue, matching wits with evil billionaires, and putting his life (among other things) in the hands of a bevy of femmes fatales. Up against rogue CIA agents, wannabe terrorists, and an arms dealer looking to make a high-tech killing, Lang's out to save the leggy lady he has come to love...and prevent an international bloodbath to boot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c8d752c968295a1fdf58477f2aee296b8844785","amp;dn":"The+Gun+Seller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c8d752c968295a1fdf58477f2aee296b8844785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,141,117,44,150,130,149,161,253,245,132,119,242,174,226,150,184,132,71,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
