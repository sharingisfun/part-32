The films in which they co-starred included Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood and Four's a Crowd (1938), Dodge City and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), Santa Fe Trail (1940) and They Died with Their Boots On (1941).\n\nIn an interview with Gregory Speck, de Havilland stated, &quot;He never guessed I had a crush on him. And it didn't get better either. In fact, I read in something that he wrote that he was in love with me when we made The Charge of the Light Brigade the next year, in 1936. I was amazed to read that, for it never occurred to me that he was smitten with me, too, even though we did all those pictures together.&quot; However, in an interview cited on Turner Classic Movies, de Havilland claims she knew the crush was reciprocal and further states that Flynn proposed, though de Havilland turned down the proposal as Flynn was at the time still married to actress Lili Damita.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n01 captain Blood (1935), size 716.138 KB, Length: 01:54:13\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026174/\n\n02 The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), size: 1.185.660 KB, Lenght: 01:55:20\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027438/\n\n03 The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), size: 1.413.368 KB, Lenght: 01:37:42\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029843/\n\n04 Four's a Crowd (1938), size: 917.256 KB, Lenght: 01:31:47\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030151/\n\n05 Dodge City (1939), size: 713.826 KB, Lenght: 01:44:01\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031235/\n\n06 The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), size: 716.702 KB, Lenght: 01:46:22\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031826/\n\n07 Santa Fe Trial (1940), size 717.018 KB, Lenght: 01:49:30\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033021/\n\n08 They Died With Their Boots On (1941), size: 826.510, Lenght: 02:19:35\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034277/\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a7ce5e3fabd888228d736d8bb473768cf2428d","amp;dn":"Errol+Flynn+-+Olivia+de+Havilland%2C+Complete+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a7ce5e3fabd888228d736d8bb473768cf2428d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,167,206,94,63,171,216,136,34,141,115,109,139,180,115,118,140,242,66,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
