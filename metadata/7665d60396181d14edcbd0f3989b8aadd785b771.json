Fuller\n\nEPUB &amp; MOBI Ebooks\n\n\nDESC:\n\nCAN THE VOICES OF THE DEAD BE RECORDED ON TAPE?\n\nAt the time of his death Marconi-the Inventor of radio-was attempting to contact the dead with his equipment. Since then other respected scientists have joined in the search for electronic proof of life after death.\n\nTHE GHOST OF 29  MEGACYCLES details the painstaking research of two American investigators: George Meek, founder of SPIRICOM, and Bill O'Neil, pioneering and dedicated electronics wizard.\n\nO'Neil's tapes crackle with static and interference, but on them voices can clearly be distinguished - the voices of 'Doc Nick' and an electronics engineer named Dr Mueller who died fifteen years earlier.\n\nJohn G. Fuller approaches the evidence in a spirit or open-minded scepticism. Those Involved are not cranks but level-headed scientists. Their incredible conclusion is that, yes-\nThe dead CAN communicate by radio\n\nNOTES: \n\nPITA To convert from PDF to MOBI/EPUB, but I think I fixed the biggest issues so it's at least readable. I didn't correct all issues from the OCR/PDF conversion tho, it would simply take way too much time.\n\nCredits to W_Wibbly who uploaded the VERY RARE book as PDF from which I converted: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8169749/Ghost_On_29_Megacycles_-_John_G_Fuller_%5Bebook%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8169749/Ghost_On_29_Megacycles_-_John_G_Fuller_%5Bebook%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMake sure to check out more John G.
