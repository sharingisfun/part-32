As many reviews of Drokk have mentioned, it's basically begging for a fan edit of Dredd that incorporates the music of Drokk in place of the existing score.\n\nThe results are so &quot;Escape From New York,&quot; that it made me want to de-saturate the colors and substitute title cards with the appropriate font. It's also mixed in mono, which both helps it sound like an early 80s movie and was a lot less complicated for me.\n\nHope you enjoy what I like to call &quot;John Carpenter's Judge Dredd&quot;.\n\n\n- The Humaniac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cdb8e4a5eab5aced1bb940a6819666a86707711","amp;dn":"Dredd+with+Portishead+score","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cdb8e4a5eab5aced1bb940a6819666a86707711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,219,142,74,94,171,90,206,209,187,148,10,104,25,102,106,134,112,119,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
