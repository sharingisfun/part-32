After Mockingbird and Hawkeye stop a gunrunning operation by Crossfire, they find themselves battling a new Phantom Rider teamed with Crossfire.  \nThe series deals with a lot of Mockingbird's history including Skrulls, the Phantom Rider incident in West Coast Avengers and more.  However it's pretty assessable with much of the history recounted at the very least in a feature at the end of the first comic.\nI'll be uling the subsequent hawkeye series that this leads into\nThanks to the original scanners and uploaders.
