It is written by and stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams, and relies largely on simplistic caricatures and heavy use of catch-phrases. Its title is an amalgamation of the terms &amp;#039;Little England&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Great Britain&amp;#039;, and is also the name of a Victorian neighbourhood and modern street in London [1]. An American version of the series will be made for HBO by Lucas and Walliams in 2007.\n\nMany of the characters on the show have their own often-repeated catchphrases. Many have become well-known in the United Kingdom, and the show has gained a mainstream following.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6af4f6098c7b39338cee0228248c6d6767057a7","amp;dn":"Little+Britain%2F%2F%7B%7B+2003-2007+%7D%7D%2F%2F%7B%7B%7B+DRATINI+TORRENT-TAINMENT+%7D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6af4f6098c7b39338cee0228248c6d6767057a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,175,79,96,152,199,179,147,56,206,224,34,130,72,198,214,118,112,87,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
