A temporary return to tiny Willow Heights thrusts her back into DonovanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and home, unearthing heartbreak and obsession that have stood the test of time.\n\nHe left seven years ago too, for war and other things Clementine can only imagine. Coming back to the town where he grew up in the shadow of poverty and drug addiction makes no sense, and neither do ClementineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feelings for him. He could never forgive her for leaving, could he? Even if she had no choice.\n\nNow, she has the freedom to choose Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and so does he. Every day in Willow Heights makes it clearer: all he ever really wanted was her, and nothing will change that. Not even a taste of the hell that drove them apart in the first place","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:095d7882f14f39f18961d63966ae9cf7d4b5fdcd","amp;dn":"Hell+Without+You+-+Ranae+Rose.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"095d7882f14f39f18961d63966ae9cf7d4b5fdcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,93,120,130,241,79,57,241,137,97,214,57,102,174,156,247,212,181,253,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
