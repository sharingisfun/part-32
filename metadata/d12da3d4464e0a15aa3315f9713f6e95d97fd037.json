He was also a prolific popularizer among Latter-day Saints of their \ntheology. A notable anti-communist and supporter of the John Birch Society,\nSkousen's works involved a wide range of subjects including the Six-Day War, \nMormon eschatology, New World Order conspiracies, and also parenting. His \nmost popular works are The 5,000 Year Leap (strongly recommended by Glenn Beck) \nand The Naked Communist. A book by Skousen on end times prophecy, The Cleansing \nof America, was published by Valor Publishing Group in 2010, four years after \nhis death.\n\nAlthough Skousen was not a tax protester, he did campaign for several proposals \nto eliminate the federal income tax. One proposal, the Liberty Amendment, \nprecluded the federal government from involvement in any activities that \ncompeted with private enterprise and returned federally-owned land to the states.\n\nIn 1971, Skousen founded a non-profit educational foundation, The Freeman \nInstitute, which sought to provide students a place to read both sides of any \npolitical issue from original sources. In 1982, the institute became the \nNational Center for Constitutional Studies (NCCS), a national organization \nheadquartered in Malta, Idaho.\n\nIn the 1970s, he spoke to a Latter-Day Saint group aboard a cruise ship \nreturning from Israel, stating that the previous 10 U.S. national elections \nhad been illegitimate because voters had not truly had a choice. He also \nreferred to what he argued was the betrayal of Taiwan hero Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nSkousen spoke of billionaire banker David Rockefeller as being one of the most \npowerful men in the world. Skousen criticized Rockefeller for praising Mao \nZedong in a 1973 New York Times article, in which he stated that the communist \nleader was one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. Later Skousen \nclaimed that the Rockefellers and Wall Street had conspired to elect Jimmy \nCarter president. Skousen was also known as a strong supporter of law and \norder and believed that local police departments were being undermined in \norder to promote a national police state.\n\nIn fall of 2007, political commentator Glenn Beck, who is a Mormon, began \npromoting The 5,000 Year Leap on his show, describing it as &quot;divinely inspired&quot; \nand written by someone &quot;much more intelligent than myself&quot;. Leap argues \nthat the U.S. Constitution is infused with Judeo-Christian virtues as well as \nEnlightenment philosophy. Skousen's son Paul Skousen asked Beck to write \nthe foreword for a new edition of the book. \n\nAfter Beck began promoting Skousen's The 5,000 Year Leap in March 2009, it \nwent to number one in sales on the Amazon.com charts and stayed in the top \n15 throughout the following summer. In September 2009, the book was being \nsold at 9-12 Project meetings and was often used as source material for 9-12 \nProject speakers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d12da3d4464e0a15aa3315f9713f6e95d97fd037","amp;dn":"Visit+Israel+with+W+Cleon+Skousen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d12da3d4464e0a15aa3315f9713f6e95d97fd037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,45,163,212,70,78,10,21,170,51,21,249,113,63,110,149,217,127,208,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
